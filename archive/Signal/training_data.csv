PR,use Loader when conversation is updated instead of requery,Our adapter for conversations and conversation lists was still doing requeries on content changes which happen on the UI thread This change takes advantage of the Loader paradigm and its built in content observation updating to take that into an AsyncTaskLoader Unfortunately you only get the cursor content observation benefits in the CursorLoader class if you are querying from a Content Provider Since we do not do that for conversations I needed to write our own AsyncTaskLoader helper class for how we fetch cursors While I have not reproduced the major lag others have experienced with large conversations I suspect this has a decent amount to do with it Should help 1941,,"mcginty,tinloaf,mcginty,moxie0",2014-09-24 21:07:02,2014-12-03 05:43:18

IS,Make re registration of same phone number more userfriendly,When reinstalling TextSecure or switching the SIM card to another phone PUSH service registration often fails because the number is already registered This forces the user to go to and unregister manually Average users do not know that they have to unregister first They even do not know the above mentioned page And that GCM eventually notifies the server about unregistration seems unreliable due to the fact that many users really have trouble with this issue and are unable to proceed using TextSecure just wondering if similar steps are necessary when web sockets come in I propose to let the registration process check if the number is already registered and automatically perform the necessary steps to unregister and re register the number When I understand the unregister web page correctly this is authenticated by receiving an SMS or call I think this is possible when using the same SIM card phone number This would greatly enhance the usability,,moxie0,2014-12-06 19:23:22,2014-12-06 20:30:49

IS,Problem with incoming group MMSs,Often when I receive group messages some of the messages do not make it to the group chat screen Instead they arrive as what appears to be a non group MMS seperate from the group chat with no contents other than a dowload button If I click the download button and stay on that screen the message eventually makes it to the group chat screen However the messages tends to show in the order that they have been dowloaded not sent which makes comprehending the conversation difficult This problem appears to only occur with messages from non TextSecure users although I cannot say for sure Only one of my contacts uses TextSecure,,"moxie0,moxie0",2015-02-16 00:02:36,2015-02-16 02:15:49
IS,BUG CRASH Out of memory JNI ERROR when sending picture via PUSH,Hello When sending a picture via PUSH textsecure crashes when pressing send After restarting textsecure the picture gets send though System Android 4 4 4 TextSecure 2 4 2 Galaxy S4 Mini Two things I read something about MMS and my providers access points in the logs Which makes me wonder because 1 I am sending via PUSH and 2 because I set 'never send MMS' Might be related to issue 2377 Here it crashes without touching the picture and just pressing send Edit again I see that this is most likely reported by issue 2372

IS,make GCM for wakeup events optional,I really dislike your latest decision to stop support for encrypted SMS MMS Not because I do not like push messages I simply do not want to install google services In my opinion it makes your whole effort for encrypted communications a farce but this is just my point of view Now I read in your blog that you are going to handle message delivery by yourselves This is really nice One thing though You want to go for GCM for wakeup events That means GCM would be mandatory for TextSecure What about using a different mechanism a periodically check manual check whatever As long as GCM would be optional I would be very glad lot is of other ppl possibly as well and this would be a good compromise for the gone encrypted SMS So would you please consider making GCM for wake up events optional while providing encrypted push through your own services without the need of google services Would really appreciate that Thanks,,haffenloher,2015-03-14 13:13:47,2015-03-14 16:33:02

IS,disable textsecure messages nag,hi i made the mistake of updating textsecure to the latest version on google play as of today and now every time i open it there is a huge blue nag screen section right at the top there is no way to close it like in the previous version dear developers for the love of god why i will never ever ever enable textsecure messages because in no particular order they are all important equally sms is free and unlimited i only rarely connect to wifi sms is free and unlimited i do not want to register my phone number sms is free and unlimited the people i talk to using textsecure only connect to wifi rarely sms is free and unlimited in previous versions there was the option to disable the nag screen and even then it was temporary when you least expected it it popped back up why for those who do not need or want this feature why are you trying to push it down the throat i really appreciate the time and effort you the devs put into this app but why are you trying so hard to turn into google facebook and the like i thought textsecure was about freedom of expression and freedom of choice was i wrong,,haffenloher,2015-03-21 00:02:49,2015-03-21 01:00:05

PR,created a set of basic espresso tests,Created a set of basic espresso tests FREEBIE All these espresso tests pass on my Nexus One running Android 2 3 6 and Nexus 5 running Android 5 1 with animations disabled Some notes from my experience with the espresso testing framework out of app activities The display of any activities or prompts that come from outside the app being tested trigger a failure of the current test This means that through espresso it is not possible to set TextSecure as the default SMS app post Kit Kat and depending on device opening the notification sound preference also results in test failure Choosing media for attachments and group images also currently should not work however I expect that the future in app media capture will be testable by espresso Espresso closeSoftKeyboard At the moment this method does not block this sometimes leads to tests failing because the keyboard is covering a view under test On emulators this reportedly is not a problem but on real devices it is a definite confirmed issue Two workarounds exist 1 Thread sleep 2 install any 3rd party soft keyboard Both are gross but I think 1 is less gross To avoid sporadic test failues use the actuallyCloseSoftKeyboard method in place of closeSoftKeyboard and typeTextAndClose in place of typeText RoutingActivity makes stuff weird Espresso kinda has this 'one activity one test' idea built in where you parameterize ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2 with the activity you plan on testing Then you can use this instance method getActivity that returns an instance of the activity under test and creates it if necessary The bummer of RoutingActivity is that when getActivity is called you get a handle to a newly created RoutingActivity and not the activity you have been routed to also if you have been routed to a new activity that activity will be destroyed Having a handle to the activity under test is cool because it allows you to manipulate and test the activity lifecycle and get references to actual views so in conclusion we can not do that stuff options menus All options menu items have to be matched using withText the more concrete withId method simply does not work here probably should not fake push registration An espresso test could be written to go through a valid registration flow but many test devices do not have SIM cards and I'm not sure we should count on internet access for anything either Additionally I do not think we should attempt to fake a push registration state because keeping up with exactly what that state should look like with every new release is complicated and I also think it is outside the intent of espresso tests I could be wrong about faking this state though if it is trivial then it would definitely increase the of things we could test maybe this will get easier with the end of RoutingActivity,,"rhodey,rhodey,rhodey",2015-03-20 22:25:04,2015-04-01 23:08:27

IS,Everyone who has my phone number can figure out that I use textsecure,We live in times where even the fact that somebody is using encryption raises suspicions In my eyes a first suspicious sign would be a telephone number which is stored in a database of a messenger like TextSecure Gathering those is a low hanging fruit because we all know that the structure of telephone numbers is very deterministic and entropy of those is additionally reduced by TextSecure Another reason is that some people just do not like that everyone who has ones telephone number knows that TextSecure is used I suggest to give more control over that The easiest solution I can imagine is that there is a cloak mode Alice uses TextSecure However she does not want that Mallory knows that Alice is using that App so Alice activates the cloak mode In this mode every time Mallory searches for intersections on the server Alices token is ignored To get in touch with a cloaked user I suggest the following approach Bob wants to contact Alice Alice is still in cloaking mode Bob can select Alice from his phone contacts for a contact request Alice receives this request If she acknowledges Bob get notified that Alice is available If Alice ignores the request nothing happens Other less convenient solutions I thought of It is not possible that Mallory can see Alice in the intersection request if Alice does not have Mallory in her contact list Here the server whould have to know and store contact link information which is bad There is a kind of challenge response technique via another channel than TextSecure which allows Bob to add Alice to the contacts More complicated and requires a second channel What do you think Greetings Noir,,"agrajaghh,2-4601,moxie0",2015-04-29 08:41:29,2015-04-29 14:24:47

IS,Attachments Quick Capture audio video recording and playback Google is Messenger Android app style,Those who have used Google is Messenger application for Android in its more recent iterations may have noticed a new feature for attachments Clicking the paperclip for Attachments besides the usual options to attach a file gives the user the option a number of Quick in app in line media capture options For instance choosing Picture or alternately Video allows the user to capture the picture or video right from Messenger a camera window is opened below the text entry box which is then added to the message to form the outgoing MMS Likewise if the user chooses the Audio tab there is a Microphone button and instructions to press and hold to record Doing so allows the user to speak a message which is then encoded as an audio file and added to the outgoing MMS From what I can tell TextSecure lacks these options While a user can send a picture video or audio file that has already been saved elsewhere I believe it would benefit TextSecure to enable these Quick Capture options both for traditional SMS MMS and Secure Data messaging Many users find these options alluring particularly the audio quick capture which allows the sending of a short audio message that can be played by the recipient at their leisure and TextSecure supporting these features would mean users who enjoy them currently on other platforms could switch and enjoy better privacy security without having to lose said features Please let me know if this seems feasible Thank you,,"agrajaghh,agrajaghh",2015-06-06 10:49:30,2015-06-06 15:59:55

PR,Modified Usage of Light Dark Colors in Conversation Activity,I have only recently started using a version of TextSecure with the custom per conversation colors but there were a couple of things that struck me straight away The fact that the action bar and text bubbles appear the same color makes the layout of the objects on screen seem less clear It suggests that they are at the same point in the hierarchy and the only thing that suggests otherwise is the slight drop shadow that you can sometimes see over a text bubble if it is in the right place In the dark theme the status bar color is lighter than the action bar this looks particularly odd and goes against design recommendations I believe This pull request makes two changes In the light theme makes the text bubbles match the color of the status bar In the dark theme swap the status bar and action bar colors Here are a few screenshots of the change original on left new on right View Full Album Potential Improvements We may want to make the action bar colour on the dark theme slightly darker maybe 800,,"samlanning,moxie0",2015-07-26 01:43:33,2015-07-29 23:26:34

IS,Linking device with no TS groups crashes,This is the stacktrace Basically I wanted to check the current status of the TextSecure Browser project Since I'm lazy rather than rebuilding the android application to use the staging server and create another account I wanted to try to use it to contact my mother and I modified the javascript sources to not use the staging servers I just removed the staging string from the urls as a wild guess I thought what is the worse that could happen the messages might just fail to be delivered well apparently I was wrong maybe because the browser plugin expects a newer version of the app but now I always get the above exception The problem still happens even after removing disabling the extension on my browser The exception does not happen if I put the phone in airplane mode but otherwise it keeps crashing and showing the related popup I tried to find a way to disassociate my browser from the phone but apparently there is no such option Rebooting the phone did not help I frankly could do without TextSecure for a few days I would switch back to the normal sms app until this issue would be fixed But afaik the only way I could do that is by uninstalling textsecure removing the account Unfortunately this would then create a new key and I would need to notify my new contacts of the changed fingerprint I would like if there was a day to do one of the following things Tell textsecure to stop connecting altogether Tell textsecure to disable automatic restart Export my textsecure is private key ok this is less than ideal but I'm already suffering from a self inflicted DOS P Also I understand that an Android application is lifecycle is not as simple as a normal Java app so it might not be that easy But is there no way to have a top level catch all exception that recognizes such an issue increments a counter to detect if the failure was a one off or is cronical and does something sane temporarily disabling itself do not let the exception bubble up to the system etc Thank you,,"moxie0,moxie0,moxie0",2015-08-04 23:14:25,2015-08-06 17:21:26

IS,Warn user about contact leakage before creating a large group,TextSecure makes it too easy to accidentally leak your contacts' phone numbers to each other It should make it more clear to the user perhaps through a user warning if a group contains more than X people that a group message to a large group will share everyone is phone numbers with everyone else Background I have been an enthusiastic TextSecure user for a couple years now but I had not done much group messaging I reset my phone and so my TextSecure key had changed I wanted to let everyone know en masse and went to create a group of all my TextSecure contacts Once I created the group before I explicitly sent a message it had already created the new group on all of my friends' phones and I quickly learned that they could all see every other person is phone number Obviously if I would done much group messaging before on TextSecure I would have known this But I had not yet and this was a rough way to learn it that resulted in me weakening the privacy of a good number of my friends I can imagine many solutions to address this but the one that I think would involve the least engineering effort would be to warn a user that phone numbers will be shared before creating a group where the group is above a certain threshold This could take the form of an OK Cancel popup after hitting the button to create a group or something more integrated Whatever the solution I believe adding friction to mass contact leakage is well within TextSecure is commitment to a UX that makes secure communication easy With a high enough threshold it is unlikely to affect many users and will only add that friction to a small number of important cases where that friction is constructive,,"moxie0,moxie0",2015-08-12 03:00:38,2015-08-12 04:40:53

IS,Second factor for re registering with the server,Currently if someone gets the ability to get my SMSes such as by stealing my SIM card or somehow intercepting them at the carrier or number cloning then the only thing standing in the way of that person impersonating me to a user I have already chatted to is the key mismatch warning Some users will click through that without thinking And someone who is never chatted to me before will not get any warning because of TOFU Since I do not think there is any intention to aggressively push users to manually verify key fingerprints it would be nice if I could add a passphrase to my registration that would not let someone register a new device with my phone number without also having that passphrase Since this adds some friction it would be reasonable for it to be opt in that is to say once I register my number for the first time I should be able to go into the settings and enable the passphrase requirement The biggest drawback I can see is that if I give up my phone number and then it is reassigned someone else will be stuck unable to use textsecure with that number I can not really think of a perfect way to solve this but expiring a registration that has not been used at all in some period of time say 12 months would probably be a reasonable approach Alternatively instead of just requiring use the server could periodically send the client a liveness check of some sort via push and clear the registration if those do not succeed for some shorter period of time 3 months if the app is not even responding at all,,"moxie0,moxie0",2015-08-27 04:43:35,2015-08-27 12:57:51

IS,TextSecure marks messages as delivered before they are even sent,Hi I have always wondered why this is but just figured it may be some sort of bug Like 80 of the time the messages I send get the delivery receipt symbol the check mark way before they turn blue meaning they have been sent Basically I send a message it is shown as pending it gets the delivery check mark and then it is shown as sent And this happens all the time way more than just half the time I thought messages turned blue after they would reached the server and got the check mark once they would been delivered But how is it possible that going from my phone to the recipient is phone and back takes less than going from my phone to the server and back Sometimes I get the delivery receipt several seconds before the message is marked as sent Is this some problem with the server being slower at some tasks than others or is it some problem with the client Thank you,,moxie0,2015-04-13 09:08:08,2015-10-22 19:40:24

IS,Problems with properly accessing contacts stored via CardDAV on older Android devices,Could it be that TextSecure has problems with contacts stored via CardDAV on older Android devices Since a couple of weeks then on 2 25 3 now 2 26 5 I'm experiencing some problems I have all my contacts stored via CalDAV none on the SIM card and none on the phone that runs on 4 2 2 1 Since a couple of weeks almost all TS using contacts are shown twice in the list of TS users and once under All contacts Only newly added TS contacts are listed once It started when I used TS 2 25 3 2 Today I noticed that one contact was listed in the conversations list and in TS' contacts list without her name only by her number Although the native contacts app shows a perfectly fine entry when I tried to call that person her name was not shown when dialing as it would normally happen instead her number was listed as an other number in the native contacts app her number is labeled mobile In fact when I tried to edit the contact in the native contacts app at the bottom there is an entry for TextSecure that cannot be edited that indicates that the number is stored on the phone with the label other In turn when I restrict the contacts to app to show contacts stored on the phone only it lists none as I would expect Does that imply that TS creates a local copy of the CardDAV phone number on the phone In fact said contact is one the many duplicates 3 I played around and separated and re joined the varying accounts via which I'm connected to said person in the native contacts app Now her name instead of her number only is listed twice again in the list of TS users but the two entries are not listed in two subsequent rows but the first entry jumped to the very top of the list before the names starting with an A I repeated that exercise with another duplicate entry to the same effect it seems that a second list of TS users is created that is alphabetically ordered and stacked on top of the other one Apologies for this lengthy post The only previous issue I found that mentions CardDAV is which solved itself when the user updated to a higher Android version,,haffenloher,2015-09-21 21:41:08,2015-11-02 20:32:53

IS,Contacts with WhatsApp appearing twice in Signal is contact list,I guess this is somehow related to 4029 but that one seems to be fixed while I'm still experiencing that kind of issue Almost all of my contacts appear a couple of times in Signal is contact list with all of their different phone numbers So far so good expected behaviour But many have additional duplicate entries with the same number it is always a mobile number listed twice One of them has the format 12 345 67890 which is exactly how I format all of my phone book is entries The other one the duplicate has the very same number but formatted as 1234567890 a format not to be found in my phone book I have noticed that as far as I looked each of the contacts with this kind of duplicate has an WhatsApp entry in Android is phone book actually 2 entries one for calls and one for messages Interestingly though the WhatsApp entries in Android is phone book are also sort of correctly formatted as 12 345 67890 I do not necessarily say that the WhatsApp entries are the culprit i e they confuse Signal But it surely looks like they are It has been like this for a long time but I just took the time to inspect this more closely I'm using vanilla Android 6 on a Nexus 5 with Signal 3 3 0,,"RiseT,agrajaghh,RiseT,RiseT,agrajaghh,RiseT,RiseT",2015-11-06 23:19:13,2015-11-06 23:31:22

IS,Add longer muting periods,I have friends who always want to mute certain groups Currently it is only possible to mute groups one week at a time which can get really cumbersome I would be convenient for them to have the option to mute these groups for a really long time Is there any rationale not to extend the muting options with longer periods like 1 year or forever 9999 years,,"blinry,blinry,2-4601,blinry,moxie0,blinry,2-4601",2015-11-08 11:06:42,2015-11-11 01:14:57

IS,No dialer integration since move from Redphone to Signal,Previous behavior with Redphone If I initiated a call from the system dialer for a user that was registered with Redphone I received a pop up asking if I wanted to upgrade the call to a Redphone call In addition calls showed up in the list of sent received and missed calls in the system dialer even if placed via Redphone Current Behavior With the introduction of Signal there is no longer any dialer integration Why the change matters I think this was a nice feature as it means a user could simply initiate calls through the system dialer as opposed to opening Signal to initiate a call This make it more likely that unsophisticated users like my mother would actually make secure calls since they do not have to do anything differently A Google search revealed another user brought up this issue but attempting to access that page results in a 404 I did not see any existing issues in Github Tested with Signal 3 1 1 and 3 3 1 on Cyanogenmod 11 Milestone 11 Android 4 4 4 on a One Plus One A0001,,moxie0,2015-11-11 01:34:54,2015-11-11 07:02:14

IS,Multiple notifications crashes app,Signal has crashed again on my phone so I am submitting the debug log that I am able to access from the login screen using the three dots in the top right corner I do not intend to submit a duplicate entry however I'm not sure if this is the same log or not This morning I woke up turned on the screen on my phone and my notifications for text messages begin coming in There were approximately 9 to 10 messages three of them hide pictures on them and I am unable to retrieve them The only way I can get the signal application to open without crashing is to have the phone in airplane mode and this does not allow for the multimedia message to be downloaded Being that I am unsure which message is causing the phone to crash I'm going to try to delete picture messages one by one It would be greatly appreciated at this point if you all would allow the next update of this application to allow those of us who wanted textsecure to revert back to it I never had this level of instability with that application on my phone it saddens me greatly that the picture messages I am probably going to be deleting are going to be those thanking me for my

IS,Response 401 Login failed on encrypted call,When i try to call another signal user over signal i get Login Failed Error Message and the call aborts Text messages do work without a problem I have already tried resolve this issue by unregistering my mobile number via the webinterface and reregistering inside signal I still get the error Debug log You will find this Exception in line 881 When i try to call my number from another signal instance from Google Playstore then an error message is displayed saying that the called party me is not capable of encrypted calls But when i use the librephone app xmikos on my mobile to call the other way around it works very well Please note that i do use the websocket version from xmikos My understanding is that this build does not change the redphone part of signal so i come here for help,,,2015-11-11 14:37:49,2015-11-13 13:36:10

IS,Encrypted call not available,My friend previously used a fork of signal and I told him to get the official version from the playstore Yet while we both have the official signal from the playstore Latest version The encrypted call option is not available The option is available for other contacts so I guess the problem is on his end What could be the problem,,moxie0,2015-11-13 11:28:27,2015-11-13 16:33:31
IS,Ca not get connected secure calls,Hello With friends we installed Signal 2 Android users and 1 iPhone and can not get connected secure calls between us We verified our keys using barcode scanner and also sending SMS works When I call a friend he has same version of Signal as we all installed it at same time he gets the call ringing but when he answers on my caller side Signal still states Calling for a while and then drops the call When he calls me the situation is same I get the call but when I answer it just states establishing connection or similar and then after a while it drops the connection We have the same issue when we try to make calls on local Wifi or 3G 4G networks I use Android 5 1 1 non roted original ROM Samsung S6 Edge Friend uses Android 5 0 2 non roted original ROM Samsung Note 3 Friend uses iPhone 5 Here is the full debug log from my phone,,moxie0,2015-11-13 13:17:21,2015-11-13 16:37:38
IS,Annoying SMS notifications when a messages have been received,I see two different behaviours when I am in Canada and in Chile whenever I send a SMS non secure text message In Canada koodo I see a check next to the message I sent and that is Good In Chile virgin a virtual provider I see a check but I also receive from 1 to 3 extra messages saying Mensaje fue recibido por 56 which translates to Message was received by 56 I believe I receive 1 message for as many cell operators roaming the message have passed to get to its destination And I guess that because the message is in Spanish Signal does not parse it in order to hide it or change it for something else The annoying part is that in a conversation it appears that infamous message every time I sent something so the thread is hard to follow Besides that I get a notification when I have not received an actual reply tricking me If you point me in the right direction I might provide a patch to fix it Update Android 4 4 Signal 3 3 1 when it just became Signal from TextSecure,,moxie0,2015-11-13 16:17:25,2015-11-13 16:43:07
IS,Sending Receiving SMS does not work when 3G 4G Wifi disabled,Since the last update on the Play Store the Signal app cannot send nor receive SMS when the phone is on GSM namely when 3G 4G Wifi is disabled Is this normal I am using a Nexus 5 with Android 6 last update Best,,"moxie0,2-4601,moxie0,2-4601,moxie0",2015-11-13 08:36:12,2015-11-13 19:25:56

IS,Signal messages delayed and unable to initiate secure calls until recipient restarts Signal app,Over the last several days I have noticed that messages are occasionally not being delivered one checkmark and I am unable to initiate a secure call to said contact I confirmed that the user is phone was on at the time he had a data connection Wifi and in fact the Signal app was opened in the background The user was able to receive emails and regular phone calls without issue Restarting the Signal app fixed the problem In addition after restarting the app he recevied all my previous messages This user was running Android 4 4 4 on a One Plus One with Signal 3 1 1 I had a similar issue with a Signal iOS user Signal 2 2 iOS 8 4 1 iPhone 5S Messages to that user went through nearly instantly but I was unable to initiate a secure call However the user could call me via Signal and my phone rang nearly instantly When the user closed the Signal app I was able to initiate a call and it rang on her phone within a second I understand that Google Cloud Messaging is believed it be causing delayed message delivery intermittently However the behavior I'm seeing appears to impact both iOS and Android clients the messages are not merely delayed but do not arrive at all until the app is restarted and when the recipient restarts his her Signal applicaiton new messages sent to that user are delivered within seconds As noted above calls are also impacted I can not see why restarting Signal would suddenly make GCM more reliable so it seems there may be a bug in Signal causing the delays and inability to initiate secure calls Would logs useful If so do you want them for me sender or the recipient that is not receiving the messages,,"heyimgay,moxie0",2015-11-15 16:30:40,2015-11-15 17:47:17

IS,Generally poor audio quality and high latency with Signal calls,Latency Perhaps the most notable difference between making a Signal and a standard cell phone call is the latency encountered In fact it was the very first comment one of my friends mentioned when we initiated the call RTT appears to be at least 1 second even when the person I'm calling is relatively close several hundred miles on the East cost of the US where Signal has a server can not find the link now but Moxie published a blog post indicating where Signal has servers for routing calls However when I call the same person on Jitsi the RTT is below 100 ms and latency is barely noticeable We are both connecting via Wifi using broadband connections with at least 50 Mbit down and 10 Mbit of upload capacity for him and 100 100 for me Fiber on my end cable on his Jitsi shows effectively 0 packet loss and sub 5ms jitter with RTT typically around 50 ms Thus I would not expect significant latency in Signal given our geographic proximity and high speed relatively low latency connections In fact my Signal calls to the US from China seemed to have similar latency to the East Cost East Coast US calls Audio Quality The audio quality in Signal appears to generally be worse than a cell phone call and is significantly worse than Jitsi or Skype both of which use wideband codecs SILK for Skype IIRC and Opus 48 Khz for Jitsi In addition I notice more cut outs and audio distortions with Signal Again both callers are on Wifi with high speed broadband connections and are in relatively close physical proximity I would imagine that implementing Opus in Signal would improve call quality generally particularly if it is allowed to run in a wideband setting as Opus is superior to Speex at all bitrates sampling rates per the documentation However I'm rather perplexed about the subjectively high latency Note Was not sure whether to post this here or on the mailing list Please advise,,"2-4601,moxie0",2015-11-22 17:36:32,2015-11-22 18:39:22

IS,Signal will not use permissions with Privacy Guard enabled nor prompt for confirmation code,Cyanogenmod is Privacy Guard has three settings for each permission Allow Ask Each Time or Deny When set to Ask Each Time it will ask you every time the app uses the permission whether you want to allow that Signal however will not even try I do not want Signal to read incoming SMS messages so I ask it to Ask If it then wants to read the incoming text message it can ask me and I can either deny or allow it for that one instance like when I'm actually waiting for Signal is registration text I would allow it Instead Signal does not even try to read incoming texts anymore This is the first app I ever encountered whose behavior changes after setting it to Ask instead of Allow so it is probably a bug in Signal or a feature if you wrote code to check for permissions So if it does not even try to use the permission because apparently it assumes it is disallowed or it broke or something then I would expect a box to be there where I can put in the confirmation code In fact I would always expect that box to be there regardless of whether the app thinks it got its shit together but that is a separate discussion Instead what Signal does is let the time expire then you can request a call which works then I reject the call and then finally I can put in the confirmation code And then what It says could not connect to server no right you only requested an SMS and a call and that worked just fine but see my other issue for that,,moxie0,2015-12-29 22:44:22,2015-12-30 05:16:58

IS,Check if Identical Publickey is send back at keyexchange,Hello there i noticed that in SMSSecure i know where i am there is kind of a glitch that if you send out a key exchange message to a non SMSSecure user and sayed User forwards you that exact Message the communication is afterwards shown to be encrypted which it most likely is but with the own publickey which will result in more gibberish being send to the user I am not sure if this affects Signal too which it probably wo not as the server automatically checks if sayed user has indeed Signal installed but a basic routine that checks if the send back publickey at key exchange is indeed not identical to ones own publickey would be appreciated Truth be told i am by no means a Cryptographer and can not estimate how trivial if at all such a routine would be to be implemented and even if this is something you consider important as it is a probably a rather rare occasion I am just forwarding this to the crypto guys which created the underlying protocol in the first place Greetings Henry Kratom,,moxie0,2016-01-06 17:53:33,2016-01-06 19:54:17

IS,Improve error handling if a member of a signal group unregisters,When creating a group with one or more contacts which are not registered with Signal there is a very clear notification that an MMS group will be created which could lead to additional costs Current experience When someone unregisteres from Signal while s he is part of a group the other group members receive error messages saying the message could not be sent even tough it is in fact sent to the remaining members of the group The error message is even more confusing because the message has the same click for more details notification next to it like messages that failed to send because the server could not be reached In the latter case you can see to which members the message failed to send and just click resend to resolve the issue In the a member of a signal group unregistered case there are no more details and nothing to do for the user Proposed experience When Signal notices that a group member is no longer registered there should be a notification that this member was removed from the group and has to be readded manually if they register again A fallback to MMS would probably be the worst option because it could create huge intransparent costs e g for European users leading to the immeadiate removal of the app I'm looking forward to your thoughts and improvement ideas Edit The messages are usually delivered even if the error message is shown But the constant error messages confuse users and make them loose faith in the app,,"agrajaghh,agrajaghh",2015-11-16 13:46:44,2016-03-10 00:34:56

IS,Request for enhancement Autoclose Signal after set inactivity,I would like to present one of our use cases for Signal on Android We use the app for sensitive information exchange but would not only like the communication safe on the communication channel side but also protected from people having access to our phones Therefore we have set a password and set the inactivity time out to a low value Often in a rush you might not be able to lock and close Signal and thus this is done automatically within a minute in our case There are situations in reality where other people temporarily have access to your phone and therefore locking the app is very important Now we would find it very useful additional to the automatic lock after inactivity we could also set an option to automatically close Signal In theory Signal offers everything to achieve what we need to be sufficiently secure if there was not bug 3172 which leaves a screenshot in the recent app overview of your communication in some cases on Android 5 which happens regularly to us An autoclose feature would also work around that problem as the app is automatically closed after a set time out if we forget to close it Automatically closing is very sensible from our point of view as it exactly does what automatically locking does Making sure as much information as possible stays private an open signal windows in the recent apps overview is some tiny bit of information we would like to avoid automatically by setting a timeout Of course if sensitive information exchange happens the user should be sensible enough to make sure he locks and closes the app but in reality all of us are human and there are situations where auto locking and auto closing saves you a lot of trouble I think this also fits well with idea of signal being as simple as possible to use I agree technology can not compensate stupidity of people but that is not what I am requesting Furthermore it would compensate bug 3172 really well as this would not have to rely on the ROM following the rules,,moxie0,2016-03-11 09:14:43,2016-03-11 18:08:49

IS,fallback to a different SMS provider than builtin SMS carrier,I have x searched open and closed issues for duplicates x read Bug description Since I do not have a phone carrier plan I use signal to send and receive messages over Wifi connections This works because I have a VoIP provider with which I was able to go through the voice based registration procedure and thank you so much for that However to send and receive SMS messages I use a different app which works pretty well In fact during the registration process I did receive the SMS confirmation message i just was not able to use it because Signal did not intercept it But that is fine as well because I could work around the problem My main concern at this point is that I need to consciously switch between my SMS and Signal apps based on whether or not I know that the user has Signal at all In fact I think there is a usability issue there even for regular user if Signal has trouble sending SMS messages e g problem with the SIM card connectivity issues how does it tell the user From my point of view here Signal tries to send the message and I get the bouncing 3 dots forever even though there is no SIM card on the phone and this will never succeed What I would like would be for Signal to be able to talk to other apps to send and receive insecure SMS messages I am not sure i clearly understand how the insecure fallback works right now it does not feel like Signal uses the builtin messaging app but talks to the SMS subsystem of Android on itself Could it be possible to fallback to some other SMS provider I guess this also applies to competing protocols like Whatsapp or Telegram what if my contact is not using signal Could I still use Signal as a unified messaging app and coincidentally invite my poor Whatsapp or Telegram user to join Signal Note that other apps would need support for such process of course I have opened an issue for my specific app but I guess there would need to be such systems in place for this to work with Telegram or Whatsapp or whatever Finally I understand if you close my feature request as out of scope but please do consider at least the case where the sim card is misplaced removed or the phone is in airplane mode Usability could be improved at that level At least having a timeout or a shorter one if there is one already would improve the situation here Steps to reproduce remove your SIM card register a SIP account with SMS support e g at install an app to manage SMS in Android e g try to send an insecure message in Signal Actual result the message never gets sent and gets stuck in the bouncing 3 dots state forever or at least I have a few messages stuck in that state since saturday so 48h Expected result detect there is no SIM card and fail or offer some configuration option to send messages through another messaging app Screenshots screenshot 2016 04 04 14 36 44 The above screenshot shows Signal functioning normally for secure messages but shows the last message stuck in the three bouncing dots state for 3 minutes Earlier in the history there are two more messages stuck in that state from saturday not shown in screenshot Device info replace the examples with your info Device HTC One S4 Ville Android version 5 1 1 Cyanogenmod 12 1 20160323 NIGHTLY Ville Signal version 3 15 2 Link to debug log immediately after the bug has happened capture a debug log via Signal is advanced settings and paste the link below,,"FeuRenard,moxie0",2016-04-04 18:46:48,2016-04-04 19:18:49

IS,Moving signal from one phone to another causes issues,Bug description Last week I was travelling Prior to my trip I had asked a question on the Signal site about migrating my session to my old phone which would not matter too much if it were lost or stolen The response I got was However it does not seem to be as simple as this Steps to reproduce This explains my pre travel actions Install signal for android on phone1 Use signal for a while Partake in private and group messages Remove sim card from phone1 and install in phone2 Install signal on phone2 At this point I am on the road with phone2 If you message people they are informed that my keys have changed which is fine However if other people post in a group chat that you were involved in on phone1 then the group is named Unnamed group on phone2 and the message entry box is un tappable You see messages come in but you are unable to send messages Then I returned home and replaced the sim card into phone1 Now I cannot message anyone The messages have a red message next to them saying Failed to send and Tap for details When you tap you see i Some issues need your attention and Failed to send There is a re send button but it does not help in this case Expected Outcome Signal should work on multiple devices per account and it would be nice if it worked on tablets too I think the issues I outline are because each user is expected to have exactly one keypair This would be fine if there were a way to share a keypair between more than one device or if Signal allowed one account to have multiple key pairs Maybe this design decision relates to the fact that a phone number can be active in only one device at a time I also note that signal still works on phone1 which has no SIM card inserted Not sure if that is desired behaviour I'm not sure what I should do to get signal working again please advise Thanks,,2-4601,2016-04-09 18:34:47,2016-04-09 18:51:22

IS,Dark Theme suggestions,I am a big fan of the dark theme so in using it I had a few thoughts about things I think would improve it I'm not savvy on all the material design guidelines from google so if I have ideas that break that you know why Here goes 1 The light theme has a blue bar on the top The dark theme is black I do not know which is more palatable but it might look pretty slick if the textsecure icon or the top bar was also blue in the dark theme 2 When there is an unread message it shows the time in blue I like the color idea but should the color match the security level i e green for SMS blue for TS messages 3 The TextSecure text at the top does not look bold like the same text in the light theme Do not know which is right but they should probably match 4 In the Settings area the checkbox for push has a sea green or aqua background which looks kinda pukey to me I would like to see it blue like in the light theme or maybe have it be black and the checkmark be blue This is in the Advanced area of Settings too 5 This one is actually in both dark and light The lock phone and option menu dots in the top right take up enough space that most if not all my contacts names are partially truncated with the ellipses Not a huge deal but is there a way to re arrange that area to show the whole name Thanks again for the effort put behind TextSecure and all the other apps you guys work on Really truly great stuff you guys are like coding gymnasts I hope these are helpful and not a waste of time,,"FeuRenard,agrajaghh",2015-02-11 00:23:26,2016-04-14 23:13:16

IS,Allow manual selection between SMS and Signal messages feature request,There were a lot of cases for this already After looking through conversations it seems that each of them references others as duplicates and so all of them are considered closed I have a person in my contact list who is mostly offline but this person is Signal user I am also Signal user ans I also often get offline When I send message to this person it stays undelivered for hours In case when it is urgent but not confidential at all I want to have an ability to send it as SMS explicitly I can just use built in SMS application to send and receive SMS as I am going to do now but it is more comfortable and safe to use Signal here too So the only wish is to let me decide when talking to Signal users what exactly I want to send Signal message or SMS Finally until Signal allows to select between its messages and SMS replacing stock SMS app with Signal just looks confusing because of above reasons,,"2-4601,2-4601",2016-05-05 09:21:28,2016-05-05 10:16:31

IS,Read notifications,I would like to have Signal display read notifications to contacts that I choose I have read the lengthy discussion in 957 about read receipts but since this is over 2 years old I would like to reopen the discussion From my point of view having a feature that transmits information like when a message was read in an app that is about communication i e the transmission of information is a good thing Whether to make this feature on off by default or opt in opt out is obviously debatable My personal opinion is that I would probably like it to be opt out on a per contact basis but to not change the current behavior for people from how it currently is it would probably be more sensible to have Signal ask the question once per contact when you start a new conversation unless a default setting is set in the settings section Even if the feature is delivered as off by default and has to be manually enabled it would be a big improvement over the status quo Because and I cannot stress this enough after reading through the discussion in 957 having a minority restrict the choices of a majority is the opposite of freedom and democracy and it seems to me these are among the most important things that free secure messaging is trying to protect,,2-4601,2016-05-10 08:43:54,2016-05-10 11:15:04

IS,Add Paranoid Mode or something similar to further encapsulate the complexity and make Signal even more userfriendly,Hey there I hope this issue is correctly placed here I want to split it in two tiers My perception of what the Signal client lacks to be even more user friendly and easily adaptable and my personal suggestion how this situation could be improved I just realized that this is a extension of 838 with a slightly different approach Its still a relevant and interesting topic in my opinion The Problem There is a huge trade off between privacy trustworthiness and usability ok this was obvious I use signal ever since it was TextSecure and started with SMS maybe 3 years ago and watched it evolve over the time It continuously became more seamless to use but in my perception some of this implementations are diametrically opposed to the reason we all use Signal privacy And on the other hand there are some features that are still very annoying and I would bet that this is because of the integrity of the encryption My Suggestion Eliminate the trade off between security and convenience Every feature that makes the usage more smoothly but on the other hand compromises security integrity privacy should be opt in opt out with reasonable defaults or a wizard to set them I assume that this could help signal to differentiate itself from the competition e g WhatsApp Threema Telegram while makeing it smoothly and even more secure and trustworthy at the same time Some examples Convenience features that should be defeatable The sync of my contacts and everything that is connected to it The option could be something like Stop uploading my contactlist to the servers with an explanation what that means to usability Annoying features that kill the user experience when re registering or reinstalling the app my friends need to manually add me to our groups My guess would be that this is because of the changed encryption keys however it annoys me The option could be something like Ignore key changes in all conversations with an explanation of what that means to vulnerability What do you think Is this even reasonable Do you have more suggestons of opt in features Best Regards,,"Trolldemorted,2-4601",2016-08-18 08:25:13,2016-08-19 00:46:34

IS,Enhance Signal to allow transfer of arbitrary file types,One of the requests that came out of the work to improve photo quality was the ability to simply send photos exactly as they are without reprocessing them In the other thread there are many good reasons why there is not an option to handle photos that way dealing with the previews display memory limitations etc It occurs to me that the way to allow this option to those that need it and also provide more utility overall is to provide an option to send arbitrary file types including photos without processing them There are currently choices for Images Audio Video when sending a message Just give us an option for Files Add an option to the attachment area for File If we pick a picture via the file option instead of the image option we just send the image exactly as is with no processing preview etc The bonus is it now works for any file type and I can finally send full resolution images without having to revert to e mail or something like that Giving us the ability to push them through as files however bypasses a all of the issues related to device memory preview etc Following the existing UI design pattern gives the user customizability over what is downloaded and when only wifi etc It also now lets us send any other document securely which would be a great bonus Not sure what the upper limit needs to be on the file size but even if it was as low as 10 MBs we could send full resolution photos,,FeuRenard,2016-11-03 19:38:27,2016-11-03 19:54:12
IS,Proposal GIPHY Support,While Signal currently supports GIFs it requires storing them on your local device which is annoying Since GIPHY has an API for searching GIFs it should be plausible to implement a client side feature where the client finds a GIF using GIPHY and then sends it without saving it locally or temporarily saving it The only issue I can see is that GIPHY would be told that a particular person is a Signal user,,nrizzio,2015-12-13 16:10:44,2016-11-06 16:54:35
