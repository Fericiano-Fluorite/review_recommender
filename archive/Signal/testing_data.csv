IS,No means to change audio stream to Bluetooth headset after establishment,When a Bluetooth audio device is already connected and selected for call audio Signal uses it just fine However when you want to swap an already established call to a Bluetooth headset there is no means to do so without disconnecting the call and establishing a new one In addition when you start a call on Bluetooth and then wander out of range such as might happen when you leave your phone in your vehicle at a gas station many phones will silently redirect the call back to the standard ear speaker In these cases when you get back out to the vehicle these phones typically will reconnect with the Bluetooth headset but will not redirect the call audio back to the headset So in addition to the speakerphone option I would like to see a Bluetooth option that would attempt to change the call audio stream to a Bluetooth headset Security considerations This could potentially pose a threat when there is a Bluetooth sniffer near the phone that is trying to use Bluetooth given the differences between Bluetooth encryption and Signal encryption It does not impact security of the call stream over the cellular or wifi networks This would seem to be no more risky than the current state of being willing to use a Bluetooth headset if it is configured before the call starts Please do not take Bluetooth functionality away several of my contacts will refuse to use Signal any longer if they cannot use it with their Bluetooth headsets,,2-4601,2015-12-21 04:04:58,2017-03-16 20:53:46

IS,Play services issue,First of all I have never come across another app that wo not allow the user to bypass the update play services popup by clicking outside the popup and then work as normal if indeed the app does not REQUIRE play services but still attempts to use it for something Signal registration fails completely if play services is not the latest possible version even if the user has it disabled You should allow the user to click outside that popup and proceed without updating using play services if in fact Signal works without it That is what most apps do if they do not require play services Second your comment about Signal being designed to work if play services is not installed on the device at all is completely facetious ALL android devices have this installed The only way to get it completely deleted is to root the device which thanks to google can only be done by using third party apps like Kingroot which is made by unknown people in China and introduces a huge security risk Therefore it is only feasible to DISABLE play services google services framework the play store and google account manager Third you ask what is the benefit of making play services disabled if it is some kind of malware Well 1 play services constantly phones home to a google domain at 1e100 net It has complete permissions to your device and knowing how google is most likely uploads the user is contacts and files and may even record audio and video without the user knowing The mere fact that it has permission to do all of that is a security risk in itself and opens a backdoor for the government to collude with google to develop spy tools for Android phones 2 Play services is constantly updating which I have found can cause major incompatibility issues and brick phones since google does not test the update on every phone in use in the marketplace Google forces the updates on users which is unethical and unnecessary if the old version is working So hopefully you can see why play services is a major problem Basically google treats peoples' phones as if it belonged to google controlling what can run on the device forcing updates accessing god knows what and constantly phoning home as any user with a firewall app can see They act as if they are only licensing the phone to the user rather than the user actually owning the phone and controlling it Honestly I would think any developer working on a privacy security product like Signal would have grasped this already With regards to publishing annoucements see,,moxie0,2017-04-22 07:34:38,2017-04-22 07:50:20

IS,UX Passphrase protect and hide only sensitive contacts,As part of an intermediate threat level model I would like to have like in GO SMS Pro for example the passphrase protection apply only to a subset of my contacts conversations which should not affect normal usage of the app for the rest of the conversations in any way The sensitive conversations should only show up and be available to interact with when the passphrase is entered For this to happen of course there needs to be an entirely different handling of the passphrase protection or just a new dedicated contacts hiding passphrase mechanism where it does not auto lock the whole app but only some conversations In this case I should have something like an Unlock option in the Settings menu rather than as the first thing shown on app launch The scenario I'm thinking of is probably a quite common one where you expect to forget your phone on a table somewhere and to have people looking through it while you are gone In that case it is not much of a problem if they can get past the lockscreen but it becomes more important that a few apps or app sections holding sensitive information be really locked down with something more complicated than what is typically available as a screen locker If I complicate the screen locker by making it a long PIN or passphrase I severely reduce the usability of my phone and in my opinion it is the same with my SMS handling app which should be able to deal with inocuous conversations quickly and easily even if I have other conversations that I want to keep under a tighter lock As for new message notifications from the hidden contacts they should have some generic new message text that does not disclose either the contact is name or the contents of what they have sent you,,,2017-05-04 21:29:12,2017-05-23 09:45:57

IS,suggestion Making signal server world readable,I respect that Signal is trying to improve the state of secure communications and is designed in such a way as to minimize the amount of metadata available to Open Whisper Systems but because it is not a federated protocol all Signal users must trust that Open Whisper Systems is telling the truth While we have no reason to doubt that it would be better not to have to operate solely on trust There should be no downside to making Signal is servers world readable except for API keys of course so that users can verify for themselves that all messages are encrypted and minimal metadata are stored,,nrizzio,2017-06-07 18:50:14,2017-06-07 22:34:34
IS,Feature request Option for Data only SMS only Both,What An option allowing the user to choose how messages should be sent For encrypted chat all 3 options would be available For unencrypted chat only SMS would be available Why A person has ran out of data SMS has ran out of free texts data does not care both wants more control has a good package and can use both at any time I have not read up on the protocol but I assume the encryption is end to end and since this once was called TextSecure encrypted texts should still be possible,,haffenloher,2017-06-07 20:20:37,2017-06-09 06:57:09

IS,Feature Request Let users choose between GCM PUSH and the new WEBSOCKET based notifying service,I have x searched open and closed issues for duplicates x read Feature description Most of signal messages I send to my buddies only get delivered or calls tried notified when their signal app is opened This was the case with me until I moved to AOSP and with the new solution for non play services users now the messages come in very swiftly even when the app is not in foreground All my buddies are on stock rom and I understand there may be issues with play services configuration etc But not everyone are geeks and everyone cannot move to AOSP for different reasons and not everyone can or wants to contact support with debug log when there are good alternatives for instant messaging already installed on their phones So if the affected users have ability to choose between type of notifying services GCM PUSH or the WEBSOCKET one it would simply overcome the issues of no sluggish notifications and message delivery,,,2017-03-02 09:41:41,2017-06-13 11:09:56

IS,Overall Privacy Compromise Created by Profile Feature,I have x searched open and closed issues for duplicates x read Not really sure how to report this I deem that it belongs here since it is not a support request and is an issue with Signal But it it is considerably more general than other bug reports I have read all of the issue tickets reporting issues with the new profile feature and all of them identify issues with the way the feature was implemented None of them speak to the addition of this feature itself as problematic I use Signal because it is still the project with the most diligent commitment to smartphone messaging privacy I have until now had high confidence that Signal development decisions would be smart and levelheaded and would not compromise my privacy The addition of the profile feature has shaken that confidence The announcement of the Profile feature in Beta which I have only now had a chance to read claims All of this is possible without sacrificing the privacy and security that you have come to expect from Signal This is not true Half of my contacts know me by one name half by another It is imperative that there is no crossover between these identities Furthermore the gmail account my Android phone is registered under is a third identity Disclosing that identity to some Signal contacts would represent a catastrophic privacy breach which could even hypothetically endanger my life Up until now there has been no cause for concern in using Signal as enforcing the segregation of these identities has presented no issues Signal is design decisions have never presented any threat to this segregation because the presumption has always been in favour of privacy The set up your profile wizard which announced itself after the update prepopulated the name field with the name associated with my Google account It would have been very easy to have accidentally accepted this as my profile name As per the Signal blogpost this name would then have been visible to all contacts saved in my phone This decision thoughtlessly left me a single mistake away from a catastrophic privacy breach The Do It Later option was minuscule and dangerously close in the UI to the very large Accept button It was initially not visible to me so it looked as if I was being forced to choose a unitary identity for a Signal instance where I was managing multiple identities When I did spot it after a reinstall several attempts to press it on my large smartphone screen were unsuccessful It took multiple attempts Before I discovered the Do it later option my compromise attempt to save an empty profile returned an error message I also discovered after temporarily choosing a privacy preserving pseudonymous profile name which would nevertheless appear highly incongruous to several of my contacts that it is not possible to delete an identity once chosen There is no option to do so and if you try to save an empty profile it gives you an error So I had to reinstall the app to delete my profile And when you do not set up a profile the app harrasses you with persistent notifications to do so during group conversations as if the decision not to is assumed to be a temporary one by the Signal devs There are several bug reports which suggests mitigations for some of these different problems although not all of them e g I have seen no mention of the prepopulation of the name field as a concern Fixing each of these problems would indeed have reduced the severity of the threat to privacy represented by the introduction of the feature I also imagine there are people who believe that simply adding support for multiple profiles would solve the issue but in my opinion this would drastically sophisticate the task of managing identities and result in accidental breaches But fixing each of those issues would not address what seems to me the major issue that this issue was so thoughtlessly introduced at all Yes it is clear that to preserve my privacy Signal devs decided it would be unwise to just automatically create a profile for me based on the name associated with my Gmail account Instead I was given a dialogue with the name prepopulated But this in itself was dangerous and the fact that I was subjected to even this danger with apparently no consideration of how it could affect people with multiple identities leaves me with little confidence that similar or worse breaches might be thoughtlessly created in the future in order to introduce some convenience feature which is secondary to the goal of a truly private messaging application Using Signal is now fraught with inherent risk and I am no longer confident that Signal devs have my privacy as their priority For me a Signal user whose privacy is paramount this profile feature is not a feature but a bug The utility added to the app by the profile feature eliminating unknown phone numbers in group conversations seems to address an edge case at best It does not enhance the privacy of the user its only effect on user privacy is to make privacy compromise more likely I cannot see how its addition necessitates the attendant complexification of the task of staying private while using the app And the reasoning behind its introduction in a dev team with a commitment to privacy is entirely opaque to me I submit this issue as a Signal user who values privacy and who has experienced a privacy scare because of Signal development decisions something which I am sure should be of concern to a privacy oriented project It is considerably longer than a typical bug report because it speaks to a broader issue If this issue can be taken on and used to improve matters that is to the good If it is simply the case that Signal is reprioritising or that it does not intend to cater to users like me with harder privacy requirements than the average but privacy conscious user that is sad to me but I accept it But it also suggests to me that it is misleading to call it Signal Private Messenger and to entice users with more stringent needs into a potentially risky situation,,moxie0,2017-10-07 17:11:52,2017-10-08 20:47:18

IS,Feature Request Signed Encrypted Backup Signal Apk,I have an idea to overcome the lack of the encrypted backup functionality Problem The problem with encrypted backups is that you can only do them if you compile your own instance of signal which can not be installed over an existing installation and can not be easily updated An encrypted backup of an existing official signal installation is not possible but necessary The titanium backup way requires rooted phones which is not feasable every time Since this issue has been open for years now without a usable sollution i propose a simple workaround that does not cost many ressources Suggested Feature The signal developers that hold the key used to sign the official apks could provide a version where encryted backups are enabled This version could be installed over the existing signal installation on non rooted phones and would finally enable users to migrate signal to a new phone without root obviously Expected outcome No more whining about missing functionality Development of a clean sollution can go on without stress Footnote Maybe hide the apk download a bit and mark ist as unstable so people wont complain if it does not work in their case,,,2017-10-30 14:13:18,2017-12-05 10:04:09

IS,search function does not include conversation content or archived conversations,Feature request I find it remarkably difficult to find old contacts conversations in Signal for three reasons the global search function does not search archived messages for either the name of the conversation e g the contact is name or the conversation content the global search function does not search current conversation content there is no search function within a conversation is options menu the contact search function only searches the address book ignoring phone numbers for current or archived conversations I use Signal to handle regular text messages I have many 100 contacts with whom I will only send or receive a 2 3 messages It is not worth my time to add all of them to my contact list Perhaps my use case is different from what the developers envisioned but I do not think it is that uncommon Actual result I go to send a message to a particular phone number I'm not sure if I have previously sent a message to that number or not I start typing in a phone number and no autocomplete option appears I am led to believe that I have not messaged that number before After typing in the full number I start a conversation and my previous messages to that phone number appear Aside from scrolling down a list of hundreds of conversations and manually reading the associated phone numbers what I described above is the only way for me to see previous messages to from that phone number Desired behaviour Ability to search all current and archived conversations based on contact name contact phone number or conversation content Existing conversations to appear in new conversation search window based on phone number,,"FeuRenard,haffenloher,moxie0",2018-02-16 03:54:28,2018-02-17 04:56:07
IS,playback of audio attachments behaves like active phone call,Problematic functionality When playing an audio attachment within Signal if the proximity sensor is triggered then the screen shuts off and audio is played from the earpiece If the screen is turned off during playback playback stops If this is intended functionality I do not understand why this would be desired I know of no other applications that behave in this way save for with active phone calls This is related to this issue but goes further Example scenario 1 A user starts playback of an audio attachment Said user continues to read messages in that conversation while the audio plays While scrolling one of their fingers or any other random object happens to briefly move near the proximity sensor The screen turns off and then immediately back on and playback has stopped For a user who is not expecting this behaviour or does not know enough about proximity sensors to predict how they will function they try to play the audio again only to have the above scenario play out again This repeats 3 4 times after which they swear loudly give up in frustration and start harassing me for encouraging them to use Signal in the first place instead of a real app that works for normal people Example scenario 2 My phone is speaker is on the back of the device The audio attachment is long and I do not want to be holding my phone or have the screen on to conserve battery that whole time I want to turn off the screen put my phone down on a table screen facing down speaker facing up and do something else while I listen to the message This is currently impossible unless I download the audio file and play it using a different app Even if I leave the phone facing upward the screen will automatically shut off after 30 seconds stopping the playback Device info Many devices all but my particular device information is Device Samsung Galaxy S4 SHV E330S Android version 5 0 1 Signal version 4 15 5,,FeuRenard,2018-02-16 04:19:12,2018-02-17 04:57:20

IS,Include Signal in F Droid,This may be flogging a dead horse Moxie himself closed several of these issues with what i suspect was a growing sense of aggravation I once again request that Signal be added to F Droid I also feel reopening the dialogue a year later has real value Moxie is correct in stating that a download from play is easier than the harrowing process of enabling third party repos in Android This request is for more security minded users and establishes a post google path forward 127 Moxie outlined a very reasonable list of requests for F Droid and his 2013 sentiments on the security of the platform were well founded F Droid now allows to distribute a developer signed version of the app if the build is reproducable by their build server and F Droid now allows installation of apps without enabling third party support FDroid allows opt in bug reporting F Droid receives annual security audits from neutral partners and publishes the results Moxie was kind enough to provide in 2017 but as the Danger Zone implies this is textbook sub optimal distribution no better than Google Play Why we need Signal in FDroid Google has been a member of the PRISM program for 9 years The fact that it joined the program at all is more than enough reason to reassess it as the sole provider of Signal Arab Spring events have proven the big 3 google facebook twitter all go predictably dark By relying solely on Google Signal cannot be quickly deployed in such emergencies where it would do the most good,,moxie0,2018-03-11 23:38:12,2018-03-12 00:08:23

PR,Reduce image stutter by using subsampling more often,Fixes 7208 On some phones zooming in on large images say a 4k image would be slow and stutter a lot This is due to ZoomingImageView using a regular PhotoView instead of a SubsamplingScaleImageView ZoomingImageView decides whether or not to use a SubsamplingScaleImageView depending on whether the image has a dimension larger than BitmapUtil getMaxTextureSize However while that method will determine the maximum size of an image that is possible to render it does not necessarily mean it can be rendered efficiently There is some size at which some phones will have to continually re upload a bitmap to the GPU as seen in this systrace taken from a Moto E moto e zoom stutter We could just use SubsamplingScaleImageView all the time it has built in logic to prevent tiling on smaller images but given that it does not use Glide to load Bitmaps we should not be over using it As a result I altered BitmapUtil getMaxTextureSize to have a cap of 2048 which from research and experimentation seems to be a good number OpenGL operates in powers of 2 if 4096 is too big 2048 is the next best bet Tested on the following devices No scroll jank on images 2048x2048 No scroll jank on images 2048x2048 Moto X 2nd Generation Android 6 0 2nd gen 6649 php Moto E 2nd Generation Android 5 1 2nd gen 6986 php Galaxy S3 Mini Andoid 4 2 2 Example test image to induce jank signal 2018 03 13 104700,,2-4601,2018-03-13 17:53:28,2018-03-13 18:29:14
