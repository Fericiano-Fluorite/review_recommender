PR,Fix gesture detection,This commit addresses 2 issues 1 Before a general GestureDetector was registered on the highest level in K9Activity This resulted in EVERY inherited activity to have a useless unused gesture detector But more than that in MessageList a second GestureDetector was assigned to the ListView On every fling gesture both detectors called the onSwipe methods which technically did the following The one directly assigned to the ListView would work corectly by mapping the local event coordinates to the right entry in the ListView The global one worked on screen coordinates so the onSwipe method would likely select the wrong ListView entry system menu bar offset For some reason this worked fine and only the correct entry was selected despite two detectors used 2 The gesture detection for the MessageView caused problems when the message itself was scrollable i e wide HTML mails A fling gesture inside the WebView would scroll the message but also switch the message This commit fixes all those by doing the following Do not register the GestureDetector in K9Activity instead make the member variable accessible by subclasses In the subclasses that need a detector register it In K9Activity dispatchTouchEvent check for mGestureDetector being null For MessageList Remove the duplicate gesture detector assigned to the ListView in the handleSwipe methods calclulate pixel offset of the ListView to make it work using the global screen coordinates For MessageView Limit sensitive area to the message header to prevent interference with the WebView scrolling Respect current behavior Force enable gestures for the MessageList Respect user setting in MessageView Make sure that after a successful swipe gesture any pending action is cancelled to prevent unwanted things to happen such as expanding the header after changing the message or a context menu popping up in the MessageList See,"src/com/fsck/k9/activity/K9Activity.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/MessageList.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/MessageView.java","m0vie,cketti",2012-05-01 01:04:48,2012-05-04 17:08:25

PR,Restore saved TCP port setting,This bug occurs with Android 4 1 Jelly Bean Saved TCP port values are no longer being restored when entering the server setup screens To reproduce Go into Settings Account Settings Fetching mail Incoming server Change the port to a non standard number e g 1234 Click Next You will likely get a 'cannot connect' error ignore it Click 'continue' The port number has now been saved Go back into 'Incoming server' again Prior to Jelly Bean you would see the saved port number 1234 With Jelly Bean the port number has been reset to a default value The cause Before this patch the code in AccountSetupIncoming onCreate did the following 1 Create mSecurityTypeView a spinner widget for selecting the server security protocol 2 Set an onItemSelected listener for mSecurityTypeView so that whenever a spinner option value is selected a call is made to updatePortFromSecurityType which sets a default port value based on the selected security protocol 3 Initialize the mSecurityTypeView spinner with the saved security protocol option value for the account 4 Initialize mPortView a text widget with the saved TCP port setting for the account On Android versions prior to Jelly Bean the execution of step 3 immediately resulted in triggering the onItemSelected listener resulting in an immediate call to updatePortFromSecurityType which initialized mPortView with a default value However this default initialization was irrelevant because mPortView was subsequently reinitialized in step 4 With Jelly Bean step 3 still results in triggering the onItemSelected listener However the subsequent call to updatePortFromSecurityType is no longer immediate instead the call is posted to the UI message queue to be invoked later i e the call to updatePortFromSecurityType is delayed until after step 4 so the saved port value ends up being wiped out and replaced with a default value in the UI The problem occurs for both the incoming and outgoing server settings This patch moves step 4 from inside of onCreate to inside of updatePortFromSecurityType Tested on Gingerbread ICS and Jelly Bean,"src/com/fsck/k9/activity/setup/AccountSetupIncoming.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/setup/AccountSetupOutgoing.java","zjw,cketti",2012-10-12 23:50:28,2012-10-21 18:21:25

PR,Wrap folder names in folder list view,It is impossible to predict what system a user may choose for creating and labeling subfolders It is also impossible to predict an upper limit for the maximum folder path length and or subfolder depth that a user may use Therefore it makes no sense to hide part of a folder path beginning or ending with ellipsis on the assumption that the hidden part is unimportant for distinguishing one folder from another when viewing a long list of folders This problem was originally brought up in a href Issue 1911 a The original issue complained of the ellipsis at the end of the path The ellipsis was later moved to the beginning of the path but that did not really improve the situation This trivial patch 1 Permits folder names to wrap on multiple lines in folder list view so users can see the entire name 2 Reduces the default font size used in folder list view to a reasonable size so that long folder paths wrap to fewer lines Ultimately the implementation of a hierarchical folder list as discussed in Issue 17 would be a better solution But in the interim this patch is an improvement over the current implementation,"src/com/fsck/k9/FontSizes.java,src/com/fsck/k9/K9.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/FolderList.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/setup/Prefs.java,src/com/fsck/k9/preferences/GlobalSettings.java,src/com/fsck/k9/preferences/Settings.java","zjw,rabcyr,obra,obra,zjw,obra,zjw,zjw,obra,zjw,zjw",2012-05-15 16:59:59,2013-01-14 04:43:08

PR,Fix inadequate certificate validation,This is a part of some changes that I had been working on In light of the recently created issue 6072 I'm going ahead and submitting this part now since it is likely related to that issue Note however that I have not contacted the source referenced in the issue so I can not say with certainty that this commit addresses the specific problems encountered there Proper host name validation was not being performed for certificates kept in the local keystore If an attacker could convince a user to accept and store an attacker is certificate then that certificate could be used for MITM attacks giving the attacker access to all connections to all servers in all accounts in K 9 This commit changes how the certificates are stored Previously an entire certificate chain was stored for a server and any of those certificates in the chain were available for validating signatures on certificates received when connecting Now just the single certificate for the server is stored This commit changes how locally stored certificates are retrieved They can only be retrieved using the host port that the user configured for the server This also fixes issue 1326 Users can now use different certificates for different servers on the same host listening to different ports The above changes mean that users might have to re accept certificates that they had previously accepted and are still using but only if the certificate is Subject does not match the host that they are connecting to This commit modifies AccountSetupBasics so that it now calls AccountSetupCheckSettings twice once for checking the incoming settings and once for the outgoing settings Otherwise an exception could occur while checking incoming settings the user could say continue or the user could accept a certificate key and the outgoing settings would not be checked This also helps with determining if a certificate exception was for the incoming or outgoing server which is needed if the user decides to add the certificate to the keystore,"src/com/fsck/k9/Account.java,src/com/fsck/k9/K9.java,src/com/fsck/k9/Preferences.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/setup/AccountSetupCheckSettings.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/setup/AccountSetupIncoming.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/setup/AccountSetupOutgoing.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/ImapStore.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/Pop3Store.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/WebDavSocketFactory.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/transport/SmtpTransport.java,src/com/fsck/k9/net/ssl/TrustManagerFactory.java,src/com/fsck/k9/net/ssl/TrustedSocketFactory.java,src/com/fsck/k9/security/LocalKeyStore.java,tests/src/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/TrustManagerFactoryTest.java,tests/src/com/fsck/k9/net/ssl/TrustManagerFactoryTest.java","zjw,obra,cketti,zjw,cketti,zjw,cketti,zjw,cketti,cketti,zjw,zjw",2013-11-23 18:49:02,2013-12-04 04:34:13

PR,potential improvement for responsiveness in k9mail,Hello developers of K 9 mail I'm a Ph D student and I'm doing research related to Android apps' responsiveness I found there are some cases in K9 that the database is queried or bitmap is generated in UI thread Does this affect the responsiveness of the app An optimization could be extracting these operations into AsyncTask For example in AttachmentView java line 174 getPreviewIcon decodes a bitmap from a stream which is a relative long computation Is it better to put them into a AsyncTask so the UI thread wo not be blocked on decoding I attach a sample patch here Also in MessageCompose java actionCompose method at line 412 invokes Preferences getPreferences which create a Storage and queries database This also lead to a potential responsiveness issue Thus I tried to move it into AsyncTask Similarly MessageViewFragment java invokes Preferences getPreferences at line 272 Note that I add a null check if mAccount null before every use of mAccount because there are data races on mAccount after put line 272 into AsyncTask I also did the same transformation for ChooseFolder java and AccountSetupBasics java There should be some other places that can be improved I can not report all of them at one time However what do you think about these improvements My thought is we can improve the responsiveness if we try to avoid the access to IO Database generating bitmap in UI thread Thanks Yu,"src/com/fsck/k9/activity/ChooseFolder.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/MessageCompose.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/setup/AccountSetupBasics.java,src/com/fsck/k9/fragment/MessageViewFragment.java,src/com/fsck/k9/view/AttachmentView.java","yulin2,pylerSM,yulin2,cketti",2014-02-16 23:14:51,2014-03-01 07:11:50

PR,Client Certificate Authentication,This implements client certificate authentication for K 9 Mail It contains some classes from the old pull request at which have been cleaned up and refactored While there are some TODOs left I would appreciate any feedback before I go on This implementation should make client certificates really usable so I tried to make it obvious that they serve as a direct replacement of passwords Thus I introduced a small view which can be used to select client certificates which is shown instead of the password field when client cert authentication is selected There are also checks implemented in AccountSetupCheckSettings to ask the user for a client cert if the server requires one even when the user selected password authentication Opening SSL sockets has been externalized into SslHelper I have tested this patch carefully but I will do even more testing in the next days What is left Import Export More testing WebDAV support Some observations made in the K 9 codebase for future refactoring We should try to move the code that is used to display server certificates into its own DialogFragment The transport and store uris should be replaced by using ServerSettings only Fun fact While Imap and Pop3 uris are designed like imap tls user password server port Smtp uris are designed like smtp tls password auth server port Spot the difference,"src/com/fsck/k9/Account.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/Accounts.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/setup/AccountSetupAccountType.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/setup/AccountSetupBasics.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/setup/AccountSetupCheckSettings.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/setup/AccountSetupIncoming.java,src/com/fsck/k9/activity/setup/AccountSetupOutgoing.java,src/com/fsck/k9/controller/MessagingController.java,src/com/fsck/k9/fragment/ConfirmationDialogFragment.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/AuthType.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/CertificateValidationException.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/ConnectionSecurity.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/ServerSettings.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/ImapStore.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/Pop3Store.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/WebDavStore.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/transport/SmtpTransport.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/transport/imap/ImapSettings.java,src/com/fsck/k9/net/ssl/KeyChainKeyManager.java,src/com/fsck/k9/net/ssl/SslHelper.java,src/com/fsck/k9/preferences/Settings.java,src/com/fsck/k9/preferences/SettingsExporter.java,src/com/fsck/k9/preferences/SettingsImporter.java,src/com/fsck/k9/view/ClientCertificateSpinner.java,src/com/fsck/k9/view/FoldableLinearLayout.java,tests/src/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/ImapStoreUriTest.java","dschuermann,zjw,dschuermann,vt0r,dschuermann,dschuermann,cketti,zjw,dschuermann,zjw,dschuermann,dschuermann,dschuermann,cketti,zjw,dschuermann,zjw,dschuermann",2014-06-05 19:14:03,2014-08-29 23:06:28

PR,Open attachment improvements,The objective of this branch is to improve the success rate when opening attachments We now use Android is intent resolution mechanism to find out whether the MIME type specified in the message or one inferred from the attachment is file extension matches more intent filters i e more apps claim to be able to open display the attachment Some apps only support the file scheme in their intent filters So if the above mechanism reports no supported apps we try again using a dummy file URI If that resolves to an app we write the attachment to a temporary directory and create an intent using a file URI pointing to the temporary file This should allow opening all attachments that previously only opened when saving them first We now also append the file name to content URIs to allow intent filters to match by file extension Previously an attachment saved to storage was automatically opened when the media scanner recognized it as supported content e g an image This functionality was added because of the fact that Open often did not work Now that it does Save no longer tries to opens saved attachments In addition to these features a lot of the code was refactored to hopefully make it more readable,"src/com/fsck/k9/K9.java,src/com/fsck/k9/cache/TemporaryAttachmentStore.java,src/com/fsck/k9/fragment/MessageViewFragment.java,src/com/fsck/k9/helper/FileHelper.java,src/com/fsck/k9/helper/MediaScannerNotifier.java,src/com/fsck/k9/helper/Utility.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/internet/MimeUtility.java,src/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/LockableDatabase.java,src/com/fsck/k9/preferences/SettingsExporter.java,src/com/fsck/k9/provider/AttachmentProvider.java,src/com/fsck/k9/view/AttachmentView.java,src/com/fsck/k9/view/SingleMessageView.java,tests/src/com/fsck/k9/helper/FileHelperTest.java","cketti,cketti,vt0r,cketti,zjw,cketti",2014-11-11 02:08:41,2014-11-27 21:59:20

PR,K9 mail code as plugin,This was the goal of previous refactoring efforts mainly 516 With all the mail handling code now completely isolated from the app code it is feasible to move it into a separate module which will ensure the strict separation in the future As a nice side effect it will also make it possible for other apps to easily pull in K9 is mail handling code Some outstanding

IS,key aware recipient chooser,For sending of encrypted mail the recipient picker should be crypto aware There are a couple of things to consider and some design choices to make Let is a go So first off the material way to go is chips chips contact chips There are a couple of libraries for that in OpenKeychain we use TokenAutoComplete which is mature and flexible but not quite material design There are also libraries based on Google is internal chips library from the GMail app like android chips but those are not really made to be anything else but regular contact pickers and I hav not found one which looked mature Since material design in k 9 is not really there yet anyways I would go with the more established and maintained option here i e TokenAutoComplete So what do we actually want to show in the list At the moment a list of e mail addresses not contacts is shown queried from ContactsContract CommonDataKinds Email This is the obvious thing to show and it seems more reasonable than a list of contacts so I would just keep it that way What I would like to add is an annotation to each address about its crypto status In OpenKeychain we have icons to show the key status a green checkmark yellow question mark and some red ones for revoked expired unsuitable for operation The problem is outside of an explicit crypto context it is not clear that these icons are about the status of some encryption key so we really can not use them here We also do not need info about special states of a key revoked or expired keys are simply irrelevant for recipient selection My proposal would be to use Threema is concept Three dots with three states one in red two in yellow three in green all others greyed out Check out ma mock up The idea is to be mildly alarming just one of three but also suggest a way to progress key available two out of three verified that thing three out of three A different approach would be a lock in different states red yellow green with open closed questionmark closed checkmark but I'm a missing the progress aspect of the three dots concept and b an open red lock next to each mail address is just a tad too alarming if the UI tells the user this is unsafe they might just migrate to a different program which is equally unsafe but does nothing to inform the user about that fact Some more thoughts if a valid or even confirmed key is available the user will likely want to encrypt optimize for that encryption without signing is not a reasonable use case and I would not support it pgp mime vs pgp inline is an orthogonal problem to everything mentioned here I would leave it for later do we need a contact picker button the gmail app removed theirs recently If we do the information it displays should be identical to the dropdown,,"Valodim,Valodim,cketti,Valodim",2015-11-26 16:08:44,2015-12-21 00:22:59

IS,Message Send Failed Signing requested but no key selected,On the current git HEAD on a device without any PGP apps installed composing and then sending a message fails with a toast saying Signing requested but no key selected The effect of this is that e mails can not ever be sent Looking at the code this seems to be due to line 51 of RecipientPresenter java L51 which checks isMissingSignKey which is true when signingKeyId is null in the current cryptoStatus If no PGP app is installed that value will always be null I think the proper solution would be to have isMissingSignKey also check if cryptoStatus cryptoMode is CryptoMode DISABLE and also set the currentCryptoMode which currently defaults to CryptoMode OPPORTUNISTIC to default to CryptoMode DISABLE as users without OpenPGP can not even open the menu to change modes The following commit shows what I propose I did not see anywhere that the current code saves a preference for currentCryptoMode So I assume this is a feature still in development but this change will allow users without OpenPGP to continue using and testing HEAD,,Valodim,2016-01-29 02:11:13,2016-02-16 21:29:11

IS,push poll battery saving wiki inconsistency,Hello having some battery consumption issues since I upgraded from Stock Kit Kat to Cyanogen13 Marshmallow I Googled about it I read about pushing polling possibly beeing related to the matter but I think the wiki here is inconsistent and thus am I somewhat lost From this page Enable push mail for this account This option is only available for IMAP accounts When it is enabled a long lived connection to the IMAP server is established so K 9 Mail can be notified by the server when a new message has arrived When this is set you do not need to select a poll frequency because you do not poll This generally decreases power consumption in addition to decreasing delivery notification delay and is a good enough thing that it can be worth selecting a mailbox on the ground that the provider supports IMAP IDLE Please note that Push might require multiple connections to the IMAP server which might not be supported or undesired by the server administration From this page What is the difference between pushing and polling Depending on what type of account you have configured K 9 may support either push or poll for fetching new mail see Account settings Fetching mail At this time K 9 only supports push for IMAP accounts Polling refers to the mail client periodically asking the mail server for new mail on some configured time increment Pushing refers to the mail client keeping an open connection to the mail server so that the server can inform the client of new mail as soon as it is received Pushing typically uses more battery for a few reasons First when you have any account configured to push this keeps an Android service running at all times This service keeps 1 open connection to the mail server for each folder configured to push which also uses battery power And lastly pushing will typically lead to more frequent communications between the client and the server Regards,,,2016-03-11 23:48:23,2016-03-12 01:22:04

PR,preload WebView widget in K9 onCreate to avoid loading time later on,During profiling of MessageViewFragment I noticed there is a long delay when the first message is displayed since the WebView widget needs to load some native libraries This must be done on the UI thread and takes more than 250ms on my Nexus 5 which is a quite noticable delay especially since it interferes with the transition animation The rationale here is that when K9 is opened the user will sooner rather than later view a message so the time to load the library will be spent on the UI thread somewhere regardless 250ms of app startup time are some more black screen time which feels a lot less laggy to me than the same time spent in the transition when first viewing a message I realize that Application onCreate is not a great position to introduce this delay either so if anyone has a nicer idea where to place this I would be happy to hear it Maybe in MessageList It might also be a bad idea to do this in the first place not sure Either way the fix is simple so I thought I would bring it up for discussion,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/K9.java,"Valodim,cketti,Valodim",2016-05-28 09:59:59,2016-05-28 10:30:47

IS,New Feature request command line to execute before stablishing connections towards the e mail server,Hello Expected behavior For me it would be very useful the application to have the possibility to store for every account an optional field command line to execute before stablishing the connection towards the email server This field would contain a command line which would be executed before trying to connect to the email server In my case this would be useful because I am planning to use fwknop in the linux server where I will have the email server The fwknop functionality gives you the possibility to close all ports of your server until the server receives an appropiate combination of tcp messages In such a case the fwknop server would create firewall rules to open the port requested for a few seconds In these few seconds the client can connect to the server because the ports are open fwknop2 is an application available in Android as open source code I suppose this fwknop2 application could be modified to have the possibility of being invoked to send the fwknop messages from the command line and then using the new feature just requested for k 9 open the ports before attemting to connect to the email server Actual behavior Steps to reproduce 1 2 3 Environment K 9 Mail version For new versions Android version For all versions Account type IMAP POP3 WebDAV Exchange For all account types P D I suppose you are very busy with other implementations In this case I could offer my services to try to program this request Although I am not very familiar with Android I have quite experience programming with Java and I think I could succeed with this development Please let me know what do you think about it Kind regards Fran frojasg1 hotmail com EDIT Post formatting changes only philipwhiuk,,"philipwhiuk,philipwhiuk,philipwhiuk",2016-10-02 16:39:15,2016-10-03 08:56:07

PR,Turn support for signed only mails into an opt in feature,I have been thinking about this one for a bit and I have come to the conclusion that signed only emails do more harm than good 1 It is very difficult to explain to non technical users what a cryptographic signature is and unlike encryption there is not really a benefit to signed only mails unless the users knows what they are all about 2 On the sending side it is not obvious why even non encrypted messages require a password entry I received different feedback about this but most of it boiled down to the simple fact that people do not want to input their password if they send an unencrypted email 3 On the receiving side the status icon has too many states Struck Through Lock Checkmark Lock in broken unconfirmed confirmed each plus unknown key plus error states which makes it quite unintuitive 4 Even among people who know what a crytographic signature is an unsigned email from a person who usually signs their emails will rarely raise any eyebrows and even less often trigger an investigation of what is going on Even a broken signature will usually be attributed to transport breakage All things considered I have come to the conclusion that signatures on emails are nearly useless even for technical users and they do increase UI complexity which distracts Consequently I moved signing of unencrypted messages and display of signatures outside of encrypted emails into an opt in setting,"k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/Account.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/Preferences.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/Accounts.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/FolderList.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/compose/ComposeCryptoStatus.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/compose/CryptoSettingsDialog.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/compose/RecipientMvpView.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/compose/RecipientPresenter.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/setup/AccountSettings.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/message/PgpMessageBuilder.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/ui/messageview/MessageCryptoPresenter.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/view/CryptoModeSelector.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/view/CryptoModeWithSignOnlySelector.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/view/CryptoModeWithoutSignOnlySelector.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/view/MessageCryptoDisplayStatus.java,k9mail/src/test/java/com/fsck/k9/message/PgpMessageBuilderTest.java","Valodim,cketti,cketti,cketti,cketti,cketti,cketti,cketti,Valodim,Valodim,cketti,Valodim,Valodim,Valodim,cketti,Valodim",2016-10-31 06:48:03,2016-11-03 00:29:04

IS,Encrypted but unsigned e mail sender has no keys but friend has encryption key,This is similar to Issue 1683 K 9 Mail should allow sending encrypted but unsigned e mail I am not advocating teaching people to separate signing and encryption as the project contributors wish to avoid I am content with the option in settings to sign unencrypted messages useful for votes or official public announcements However there should be a way to send encrypted but unsigned e mail Not the option to do so mind I am saying that people who do not care about encrypting stuff for themselves and do not sign or have not yet set up their own private key set should be able to send encrypted unsigned mail Here is what I am advocating 1 If the sender has a private key with signing and is sending to a recipient with encryption keys and the message is set to encrypt the message with the recipient is public key then always sign with the sender is private signing key and encrypt with the recipient is public encryption key 2 If the sender does not have a private key with signing only an encryption subkey or if the sender has no private keys at all and is sending to a recipient with encryption keys and the message is set to encrypt the message with the recipient is public key then K 9 and OpenKeychain should say we can not sign and encrypt because there is no private signing key but rather than trash this message we should at least encrypt it because we can The current process is this 1 If the sender has a private key with signing and is sending to a recipient with encryption keys and the message is set to encrypt the message with the recipient is public key then always sign with the sender is private signing key and encrypt with the recipient is public encryption key 2 If the sender does not have a private key with signing only an encryption subkey or if the sender has no private keys at all and is sending to a recipient with encryption keys and the message is set to encrypt the message with the recipient is public key then sending will fail I am an advocate of signing unencrypted mail always and signing encrypted mail always if possible However this current situation preventing someone from sending encrypted e mail if that person has no key or no signing key presents hurdles When teaching someone how to use K 9 Mail to send encrypted mail to me having that friend practice sending encrypted mail using my encryption public keys is the first step Use already existing material for practice and demonstrations Helping that friend get set up with her his own private key and explain the signing subkey are the second and third steps Please bear in mind that this is my suggestion request and not a demand I have not contributed code and I applaud and thank your success in reaching 5 200 PGP MIME and new UI for cryptography,,"cketti,cketti,Valodim,cketti,Valodim",2017-01-02 19:40:25,2017-01-02 19:51:28

IS,HTML email bodies not always displaying correctly,I identified a problem in that this new version is not fully accepting of 'all things HTML' My example is this Steps to reproduce An email body of the following body source Expected behavior In the OLD version used to appear correctly as Hmailserver service shutdown Ok Spamassassin service shutdown Ok Spam Assassin Def Update Failed Spam Assassin Service startup Ok Hmailserver service startup Ok Zip Ok Email Cleardown Script Ok See attached log file below for details Where the bold is actually in red text Actual behaviour However now in the new version it appeared as Spam Assassin Def Update Failed See attached log file below for details Screenshot screenshot 2017 01 06 21 25 55 Note the missing lines compared to the correct version I needed to change the source to replace the tags with the correct REM tags to make it all appear correctly ie tr td Hmailserver service shutdown td td Ok td tr Now some could argue that may not be official html tags and that causes the problem which clearly they do in this new version My argument to this is that if they are unofficial HTML tags then they should be ignored and no attempt to interpret them should be made and therefore not alter the display in any way which is exactly what happened in previous version So this version is not accepting of certain HTML formatting in some way they have broken something and I suspect that it is this same change that is causing problems with HTML emails not necessarily with them containing tags but who can know what else this version doesnt like rightly or wrongly Environment K 9 Mail version v5 202 Android version 4 2 1 Account type IMAP POP3 WebDAV Exchange IMAP,,"philipwhiuk,philipwhiuk,philipwhiuk",2017-01-17 09:49:42,2017-01-22 20:40:23

IS,Allow another identity to be marked as the Sender of emails from an identity,I have searched for existing issues some relate to identities e g 1117 or 935 but they are not addressing my problem need Expected behavior I would like to be able to use K9 the way I use Outlook user agent on my PC and then be able to finally get rid off it in the from field write any email address I want and have the mail sent with this address as From Actual behavior When I use a K9 identity the smtp server of my mail host one com rejects the mail error 554 5 7 1 but again it works when I use Outlook Why I had a look in the headers of a successfully sent message from Outlook UA the From is what I typed but the Sender is my regular email account with which I authenticate on the SMTP server I am pretty fine with this I would suspect K9 maybe puts my 'From' address in the 'Sender' header as well which would cause the error or maybe does not set it at all I tried to see the headers of a rejected email from K9 I have not seen the Sender tag but it had not been sent so which would be treated the same way I have also spotted something strange in the rejected email is headers the message ID was built with the domain of the From address not the one of my actual SMTP account 'Sender' maybe is it also a possible cause Why all this I own my domains and I have set up specific sub domains for emails I can put anything before the ' ' and I will get emails sent to it kind of catch all but with rules behind That way I do not have to actually 'create' aliases cumbersome I can provide an arbitrary one any time and it will work most of the time name company website I can therefore spot when one of these addresses is misused and create a rule to trash all mails received through it if needed However this solution does not allow me to isend' mails except with the Outlook UA I have not found an Android UA capable of this and I have tested a lot of them I would just love if K9 was able to do it either by default or as an extra option in the identity settings Please confirm how K9 handles the identities as long as there is no SMTP settings per identity I am personally not interested in this feature it would seem logical to me that the Sender header and message ID derive from the SMTP account being used to authenticate not from the From header coming from the identity From email address would not it Environment K 9 Mail version 5 203 Android version 6 0 1 Account type IMAP POP3 WebDAV Exchange IMAP,,"philipwhiuk,philipwhiuk,philipwhiuk,cketti,cketti,cketti,cketti",2017-01-23 17:09:46,2017-01-24 16:53:12

PR,Enhance test for database upgrade process,As proposed in issuecomment 277963119 I have extended the test for the database upgrade process which was introduced in 2158 There the test was restricted on the existence of tables indexes and triggers Now the test also checks the structure of these entities using the sql column in sqlite master Fortunately I have only found one issue with this new test and that is minor It concerns the column notify class of table folders Using the upgrade process this column is created with default 'INHERITED' However when the database is created from scratch the default is missing Therefore I have added the default value to dbCreateDatabaseFromScratch to fix the test However this approach show also the lack of current tests They test only if upgrading from a virtual v29 database comes to the same result like creating a new one from scratch see 2158 But additionally a respective test would be nice for every release not only v29 Because you have to note that my solution for the notify class column only applies to future new installations People with a former new installation of a release with database v50 and above will still not have the correct default value Nevertheless I have chosen that approach because the default should not be that important and we would have to re create the whole table in order to change it But the message is that there may be much more problems of this type They can only be detected with a test of the upgrade paths of every release However that is not that easy but I have some ideas how to realize this I will write them down in a new issue in the next days But for now this pull request is good enhancement smile,"k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mailstore/StoreSchemaDefinition.java,k9mail/src/test/java/com/fsck/k9/mailstore/StoreSchemaDefinitionTest.java","korelstar,cketti,cketti,cketti,korelstar,korelstar,cketti,korelstar,philipwhiuk,korelstar,philipwhiuk,cketti",2017-02-09 15:38:16,2017-02-12 12:11:33

PR,fix issue 2057,issue 2057 I reproduced it and found the reason of this issue getView method in RecipientAdapter was called several times getView 0 null parent is called firstly Suppose the view created for position 0 in the first call is view A then getView 1 A parent and getView 0 A parent are called Maybe it is a intended behavior of Android system In most instances the information of position 0 will be filled in View A again in the third call But in our app the contact photo is loaded by Glide asynchronously So when the photo of position 1 is completely loaded it will override the photo of position 0 especially when the contact of position 0 does not have a photo the fallback image will be loaded rapidly And the reason why the wrong photo is corrected when the input continues is getView for view A is only called one time then The reason why the photo is correct if we see a wrong photo clear the input and then type the name again is that Glide has already cached the image and retrieve it more rapidly My solution is use a map to map the position to view explicitly Could this solution be accepted,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/compose/RecipientAdapter.java,"daquexian,cketti,daquexian",2017-03-02 03:22:23,2017-03-02 03:51:12

IS,K9 does not reject expired SSL certs warnings could be more user friendly,Hi I think k9 is failing to reject expired self signed SSL certificates and or the warnings have not been clear enough I noticed this when I installed claws mail on my laptop ssl At first I did not believe what I was seeing as mbsync an IMAP synchroniser I am using was not complaining but then I went to the server It has indeed expired so we have a side issue for mbsync here too I will be raising a bug I do not recall ever seeing K9 warn me that the certificate has expired I have just deleted the account from K9 and re added it This is what I see k9 There is a subtle issue here I expect to see a warning about the certificate being invalid due to it being self signed People self sign all the time and it is generally OK as long as you check the fingerprint matches However if the certificate is expired that is another arguably more severe matter I wonder if K9 should make a distinction A question I can not yet answer is what happens if the user initially sets up an IMAP account accepts a self signed but current unexpired SSL cert then later the cert expires This must have happened to me at some point yet I do not recall K9 warning me that is not to say it did not but perhaps it was not explicit enough Does it just accept a cert forever more Expected behavior When making an account Explicitly warn the user if the signer is invalid Give a separate explicit error message if the certificate has expired If the user dismisses the warning that the cert is expired warn again later say once a day Maybe too extreme After setting up an account Warn explicitly when a previously accepted certificate expires sorry if it turns out K9 does do this but I missed the warning Arguably if I missed it it was not clear enough Environment K 9 Mail version 5 206 Android version 66 0 Account type IMAP POP3 WebDAV Exchange IMAP The server side is dovecot Thanks,,philipwhiuk,2017-03-30 20:58:01,2017-03-30 21:41:45

IS,Bug Regression Upgrading from K 9 Mail 5 008 to 5 010 breaks its Share functionality under AlienDalvik AOSP 4 1 2 K 9 always crashes,Upgrading from K 9 Mail 5 008 to 5 010 breaks its Share functionality when attaching a file to an email under AlienDalvik based on AOSP 4 1 2 in Jolla is SailfishOS 2 0 1 11 K 9 always crashes a pop up window is displayed stating Unfortunately the application com fsck k9 has stopped OK By clicking on OK K 9 restarts and saves the message in the Drafts folder but without the file being attached I checked the following Using the Share functionality between other applications works I tested between Amaze OpenKeychain TurboEditor and a few native SailfishOS applications Using the Share functionality in other Android applications in order to send a file to K 9 Mail always crashes K 9 in exactly the same way as described above no matter if K 9 was running or not Sharing data not a file does not crash K 9 Mail but seems to exhibit another bug a handle is inserted into the mail body not the data sent e g with data sent from BarcodeScanner Subject Barcode Scanner Plain text Body market I will file a separate bug report when sufficiently tested to write up something more comprehensive It also makes no difference which Android application is picked when using the Share functionality from within K 9 Mail for attaching a file to an email K 9 always crashes Tested with Amaze file manager and TurboEditor Only when I pick SailfishOS' native Gallery application which is the third application offered besides Amaze and TurboEditor when attaching a file in K 9 Mail on my Jolla Phone K 9 does not crash and the file is indeed attached But it is not Android is internal Share mechanism being used here instead the still somewhat fragile Share functionality between Android and SailfishOS applications provided by Jolla is SailfishOS 2 is utilised In this specific case attaching a file to an email in K 9 it even works consistently stable but unfortunately SailfishOS' native Gallery app allows to select picture file formats e g jpg png only After downgrading from K 9 Mail 5 010 to 5 008 the Share functionality works fine again I am sure willing to make further tests checks and balances when provided with instructions how to Please do try to fix that as the inability to attach arbitrary files to emails in K 9 Mail renders the beautiful and feature laden K 9 useless as a generic email client Cheers and Kudos for maintaining and enhancing the best mobile email client I am aware of And I am really looking forward to the progress on PGP MIME P S I suspect the MIME handling changes introduced in K 9 Mail 5 009 to be the cause From K 9 is changelog on 5 010 5 009 Improved MIME type handling when other apps share files to K 9 Mail,,"Valodim,cketti,cketti",2016-06-25 15:08:31,2017-06-19 20:46:18
