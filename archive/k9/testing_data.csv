PR,Crypto status dryrun,This PR changes how the crypto status icon is displayed and most importantly calls out to OpenKeychain to retrieve information about the state of selected recipients This comes with a cost in complexity since that call is made asynchronously and there is a new weird state where the status is not yet retrieved and the user presses send However this should be so rare that it should never come up in practice which is why I silently abort the user interaction rather than add even more complexity to handle it From OpenKeychain is side the mechanism works as a dry run for sign encrypt following the same codepath as a regular sign encrypt operation but aborting the process once all metadata is gathered returning with a status This requires a development version of OpenKeychain that includes this PR I will push for a beta release with that included to make this easier to test Sadly it is not possible to be compatible with older openkeychain versions here unless I keep the old crypto status mechanism around which I really do not want to do The plan is to release this in OpenKeychain earlier than K 9 and just error out for older versions,"k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/MessageCompose.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/compose/AttachmentPresenter.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/compose/ComposeCryptoStatus.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/compose/RecipientMvpView.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/compose/RecipientPresenter.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/message/PgpMessageBuilder.java,k9mail/src/test/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/compose/RecipientPresenterTest.java,k9mail/src/test/java/com/fsck/k9/message/PgpMessageBuilderTest.java,plugins/openpgp-api-lib/openpgp-api/src/main/java/org/openintents/openpgp/util/OpenPgpApi.java","Valodim,dschuermann,Valodim,Valodim",2017-04-12 16:45:38,2017-08-22 23:38:08

IS,DNS issue with K9,K 9 seems to be caching DNS lookups which is causing an issue when I use it on my internal network I operate an email server out of my home network It is reachable from both outside my network my router port forwards incoming connections to the email server and inside my network by connecting directly to the server is internal IP address K 9 is able to access the server when outside my network e g when on my cell carrier is LTE networks But when I'm inside my network K 9 is not able to access the server it can not send or receive messages The reason has to do with DNS I access my server via a DNS name I use a dynamic DNS service so that externally my DNS name is associated with the external IP of my router Internally however i e behind my router I operate my own DNS server and so in my internal DNS I associate that DNS name to the private IP address of the mail server The net effect should be Outside my network the DNS name points to my router which port forwards to my server Inside my network the DNS name points directly to my server So in either case network access to that DNS name should go to the server However that is not what is happening with K 9 External access works fine But inside my network K 9 seems to be ignoring my internal DNS server Instead it seems to be looking up my DNS name against an external DNS server or perhaps it is just looking up the DNS name in some internal cache Whatever the cause may be the result is that K 9 resolves the DNS name to external IP address of my network and then tries to connect to that external address even though it is inside my firewall and should be connecting to the internal address And since the external IP address is the address of my router not my mail server K 9 tries to open connections to my router to send receive email and obviously fails The net result is that K 9 can not send receive messages to from my email server when I'm on my home wifi network Note that this problem only happens with the K 9 mail app on my phone When I use other apps e g the UC Web browser on my internal network they are able to successfully resolve the DNS name to the internal address and so can successfully make connections to the server Expected behavior When I try to send receive messages to from my email server while on my home network K 9 should do a DNS lookup that gives it the internal address of my home email server and so it should be able to successfully send or receive Actual behavior When I try to send receive messages to from my email server while on my home network K 9 either does a DNS lookup that gives it the external address of my home email server or reads the external address from some DNS cache and so is not able to successfully send or receive Steps to reproduce 1 Connect to my home wifi network 2 Try to send an email through K 9 It fails cannot connect exception 3 Turn off wifi on my phone and try again to send It succeeds Environment K 9 Mail version 5 206 Android version 7 1 2 Account type IMAP POP3 WebDAV Exchange Both IMAP and SMTP,,"cketti,cketti",2017-06-02 15:40:57,2017-10-28 17:28:39

IS,Transparant TOR onion support,This is a lightweight suggestion compared to the SOCKS support issue When an server address ends in onion then use the orbot SOCKS proxy if it is available No confirmation is required If Orbot is detected and the root domain is onion then just use TOR Otherwise do not If both are true then it is safe to assume that the user wants to use TOR In fact checking for Orbot may be a bit redundant Failing to connect to it when there is a onion domain would indicate to the user that an action is required And also if possible detect transparant VPN mode If we already use TOR through that we do not want to nest the connection I know that for HTML mail there may be a problem with privacy The quick and dirty solution for this is to disable HTML mail on accounts that use onion servers As Orbot already has transparant proxying there is no need to have an option that routes everything through TOR What we need is selective routing of onion domains only,,"philipwhiuk,cketti",2018-01-14 11:04:29,2018-01-19 02:34:12

PR,Fix for drafts getting deleted during IMAP sync,This is a possible fix for issue 2164 Specifically the following scenario mentioned in that issue 1 Create a draft email with text in the body 2 Select encrypt or encrypt if possible 3 Save draft by selecting either save draft or by pressing back and save draft 4 Draft is gone after server sync As per the comment by on Jan 7 in issue 1983 the intent at least until draft encryption is implemented is to save drafts of secure messages encrypt encrypt if possible locally only and not upload them to the server during IMAP sync But as mentioned above such drafts are getting saved locally initially but then getting deleted during the sync As per my testing the issue of drafts getting deleted during sync seems to have been there for a while In releases 5 108 to 5 200 which I tested drafts of secure messages were getting copied to the server in plain text issue 711 and normal drafts were getting deleted upon sync opposite of the 2164 scenario mentioned above Hope my fix addresses the issue adequately Please let me know if any further changes are required Note I am planning to apply to k 9 as part of GSOC,"k9mail-library/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mail/Flag.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/MessageCompose.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/compose/SaveMessageTask.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/controller/MessagingController.java,k9mail/src/test/java/com/fsck/k9/controller/MessagingControllerTest.java",cketti,2017-03-18 20:58:01,2018-02-24 23:54:36
PR,Fix 2 for drafts getting deleted during IMAP sync,This is the second possible fix for issue 2164 and builds on the work submitted as part of PR 2407 which I had submitted a couple of days back This fix expands on the approach used in PR 2407 to also fix the issue of drafts not retaining cryptomode setting across draft editing sessions described in the following scenario 1 User starts composing a message 2 User sets the cryptomode setting to one of the non default ones i e do not encrypt or encrypt 3 User saves the draft with the intention of continuing again later 4 User re opens the draft in order to continue editing further 5 The cryptomode setting automatically gets reset to the default setting of encrypt if possible I have gone through some of the material about why cryptography features are implemented in a certain way in k 9 but have not been able to find any reason for automatically resetting the cryptomode setting back to encrypt if possible It seems to me that as long as users are given the option to change the cryptomode setting the setting made by them for a draft should be retained across draft editing sessions until they decide to change it again for some reason This fix saves cryptomode setting along with the draft and then restores it when the draft is re opened for further editing and of course also prevents the deletion of secure message drafts during IMAP sync Please let me know if any changes are needed,"k9mail-library/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mail/Flag.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/MessageCompose.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/compose/ComposeCryptoStatus.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/compose/RecipientPresenter.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/compose/SaveMessageTask.java,k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/controller/MessagingController.java,k9mail/src/test/java/com/fsck/k9/controller/MessagingControllerTest.java",cketti,2017-03-20 14:50:50,2018-02-24 23:54:59
