IS,DX WebProfilerBundle Add HTTP return code in the Ajax request list table,Hi It would be nice to have a new column to get the HTTP return code of the AJAX request Sometime the request list contain one failed request and instead of having to go into the profiler it would be easier to directly have the failing one and go to the profiler entry straight away,,,2016-01-25 12:30:47,2016-01-27 04:53:44

IS,DX WebProfilerBundle Provide quick links to redirect responses in the toolbar,On pages where an application silently redirects a user away it may be confusing or difficult to debug because the toolbar may no errors the result is not what the developer expected and may not think to check redirects As an example a developer tries to login from login it fails but they do not know why because the current page load for login shows all green and has no log messages They would have to know to go through the profiler to find the login check request and look at the log there Further even if they know that the got looped around it would be much more convenient if the toolbar provided a link to those profiler pages instead of needing to go look it up My proposal is a toolbar tab similar to or perhaps an expansion of the AJAX tab which lists the result execution time and profiler link to pages that were loaded between the last page I was on and the one I'm currently on I'm not familiar with the internals of the toolbar so am unsure about how this might be implemented but perhaps by looking at the Referrer and matching that to recent profiler logs,,"xabbuh,iltar,javiereguiluz,iltar,stof,stof,fabpot,javiereguiluz,HeahDude",2016-01-23 00:43:58,2016-01-27 11:31:38

IS,FormType dependency injection,In Symfony 3 there is no other way to add dependencies to form types then defining them as services Those who want to use the form bundle stand alone have no chance to have some dependency injected to the type since Symfony itself handles the instantiation inside the form factory I would like to suggest to let the clients use an instance of a FormTypeInterface as the first parameter in the FormFactory create method or an FQCN string as it is now and internally do not create other instance of the type This way whenever you need the FQCN you can have it with get class formType but client is still able to provide their own dependencies without registering services,,"Tobion,stof,Tobion,stof,stof",2016-01-28 15:53:43,2016-01-28 19:00:11

IS,Thoughts about releases and bugs,Hi everyone I write this issue because I'm kind of bothered and suprised about how some bugs and BC breaks are easily introduced on almost each version of Symfony especially on the form component 2 7 was released with major bugs in the form component In 2 8 I encountered a bug on CollectionType about entry options option replacing options option but the prototype was still created from the options option 3 0 3 introduced a bug in the choice list The choice value was not pre set anymore from existing form data I found an opened issue and PR fixing it so I waited for the 3 0 4 3 0 4 fixed the choice list issue and boom another bug this time on the NumberType which does not cast its value to float So all my float validation breaks There is already a PR to fix it but one more time I have to wait for the next version or install the dev master version And there are only some of them I can recall I do not remember the last Symfony version I used without this kind of annoying and obvious bugs I'm not questioning the awesome work that Symfony contributors make I know many of them contribute beside their own job I know it is not an easy task to manage all that stuff But my point is I think there is a lack of checks and tests before a tag is released These bugs are not edge cases they concern basic functionalities of the framework used in a large amount of Symfony based applications and are easily detected Am I the only one to think that way Is the framework functionnaly tested somehow before each release What do you think about enforcing the tests on basic Symfony functionalities Could it be a good idea to write functional tests like Symfony WebTestCase or behat features covering basics use case with controllers forms validations,,"javiereguiluz,xabbuh,stof,javiereguiluz,HeahDude,HeahDude,HeahDude,HeahDude,HeahDude,iltar,HeahDude,HeahDude,iltar,HeahDude",2016-04-01 11:33:44,2016-04-01 18:00:30

IS,LDAP User Provider wrong handling of passwords,Hi trying to use the new LDAP component I think I have found a bug on the Component Security Core User LDAPUserProvider Concretely LDAP on successful authentication retrieves an array with each user parameter and each of this have at the same time another array Due to this on this new version among other improvements the Entry class was introduced to handle this situation but on the method loadUser when it creates a new user it gives as a password the Entry for the password field without taking into consideration that at the same time is an array of passwords It is needed to get the first one which should be the only one as we only authenticate one user at a time This problem makes LDAP fail to completely authenticate the user Also it does not allow symfony to store the remember me cookies correctly This is because the token generator requires requires a single element not an array on the password parameter And there is a second bug on the same class on the method refreshUser when it creates the User instance giving a null as a password instead of calling user getPassword as it looks like it should do I have done a quick and not necessarily good fix on my own fork to check this issue and it worked fine just with this small changes To reproduce install a LDAP server configure it using this doc as a reference Except the part of the service definition that as mentioned on issuecomment 204075790 on the new version has to be defined like this And after an initial successful authentication you should be getting a redirection loop to the authentication layer as LDAP constantly fails to authenticate the user given that it tries to authenticate with a null password If someone else has the same problem and this bug can be confirmed I can make a pull request with a fix Also on this side I'm not sure what the rules on fixes are on symfony but it would be nice to add a fix for the 2 8 branch as well which had the same issue and the bug is solved pretty much in the same way,,"csarrazi,csarrazi,csarrazi,csarrazi",2016-04-01 07:28:17,2016-05-26 07:52:43

IS,Serializer PropertyAccess Support immutable objects,The Serializer is amazing at transforming a data structure into another and ObjectNormalizer does a great job at figuring out how to denormalize and object It avoids to have to rely on a lot of custom normalizers unless performances are critical However it does not support immutable objects which is a bit sad as it forces user to create custom normalizers each time Or rather to be clear it does not support withers i e methods returning a new modified instance There would be two ways to do it 1 Add support for wither in the PropertyAccess 2 Bypass the property access in this case About 1 it is a bit tricky because when using setValue object 'prop' 'val you would expect object being modified not having a new modified instance However I would think it is still valid because you are passing object reference meaning what you want to set is the variable value and that you do not really care if the object is immutable or not 2 is more difficult than it looks Because it would imply to have a set attribute strategy what should the serializer look for Trying to set the attribute via the property accessor first and then falling back to the wither or vice versa Besides there would be a lot of redundancy with the property accessor PropertyAccessor is not just about setting the value it is also about finding how to set it i e figuring out what the mutator is and we would have the exact same problem to solve and I do not really think this belongs to the Serializer I'm ready to work on it but needs to hear people opinion on the topic cc,,"theofidry,kix,theofidry,kix,theofidry,theofidry",2016-07-05 11:06:26,2016-08-05 10:09:01

IS,What direction is Symfony heading in,Hello After almost 1 5 years of not using Symfony I have a new project that I would like to use symfony for But after reading up on the best practices for 3 x and looking at the directory structure I noticed some differences For embedding assets into your project it is now advised to use the web directory because it makes the lives of designers and frontend developers easier Now what I remember is that Bundles should be setup in a way that they can run independently from each other or maybe depend loosely on one another Now if I have a bundle that has some custom CSS that CSS must by put according to best practices in the Web directory Making it very difficult to properly deploy that Bundle into multiple projects I also noticed a tests directory in the root of the project With a default layout of tests AppBundle Controller DefaultControllerTest php Why are tests not in the same directory as the src AppBundle X directory Even the templates for the AppBundle are again placed in the app Resources views directory instead of src AppBundle Resources views To me it feels that new developers are giving the instruction to scatter files over the app web src tests directories Giving a project no clear direction where files are And projects will not be self contained into one directory Why is there no clear single src AppBundle containing all code required to run the bundle What is the idea behind this and what is the direction syfmony developers see this heading in I prefer to have directory structures like this The last one is purely personal preference and it does not fit anything ever used in Symfony so I understand that something like that would not be introduced But in the second example code belonging to anything AppBundle does is added to the AppBundle directory Making it easy to re use in other projects or remove from the current project entirely,,"ro0NL,ro0NL,ro0NL,sstok",2016-08-07 05:48:48,2016-08-07 08:59:12

IS,RFC Future of the Symfony HttpCache and its usage in production,Hello everyone I open this issue as a request for debate around the Symfony HttpCache and especially about its usage in development and production A few days ago I stumbled upon the issue HttpCache files getting too big which is a problem only because the HttpCache is used in production Philosophically the Symfony HttpCache was designed as both a development tool to get logs about the application HTTP cache configuration hits misses etc and as in production environments as a simpler replacement for Varnish or other HTTP proxies especially when the application run on a shared host While this usage in production is currently supported but not recommended it has limitations and issues see I would like to discuss the evolution possibilities in this RFC I see four options but there are probably more do not hesitate to propose 1 We create two separated modes one for dev and one for prod The one for dev is integrated into the debug tools and the other one is designed for production Pros current installations can be migrated to the production version while having the debug tools for HTTP cache in the profiler Cons We have to deal with the usage of HttpCache in production officially which requires maintenance and support We also have to fix the current issues with HttpCache in production 2 We do not change the code and simply explain in the documentation that the HttpCache is not designed for production We could also add documentation about how to use it in development Pros easiy to implement does not require code changes Cons I think it introduces more confusion than solves anything and is likely to do not solve the issues we currently have 3 We do not change the code and keep the support of production but we list in documentation the known limitations and officially explain these wo not be fixed Pros easiy to implement does not require code changes and is clearer than 2 Cons supporting HttpCache officially in production with limitations may become a problem to some people 4 We deprecate the usage of the HttpCache in production in 3 2 3 3 and remove the possibility in 4 0 In parallel we integrate it more deeply with the debug profiler in order to get the same debug informations hits misses but in a debug environment and therefore we become clear about the fact that the HttpCache should only be used in development We could provide this HTTP cache debug features as an opt in in 3 X and enabled by default in 4 0 Pros it shows the idea behind the Symfony HttpCache and answer the issues with its usage in production do not use it in production Cons current people having to use the HttpCache in production as they do not control their environment shared environments for instance wo not be able to use an alternative and wo not get any HTTP cache anymore I would like to get opinions What do you think Do you have an interesting use case for this debate,,"tgalopin,stof,tgalopin,jpauli,Toflar,barryvdh,stof,Pierstoval,Crell,Pierstoval,Toflar,fabpot,nicolas-grekas,javiereguiluz",2016-08-22 15:32:59,2016-08-29 06:45:53

IS,DX Logging deprecations,TL DR There should be an easy way to see whether deprecation errors occur in production so you can know whether you are really ready for Symfony 3 We are busy updating our applications to Symfony 3 The simple approach of this problem would be to Fix the most obvious deprecations that turn up in the dev bar Update to Symfony 3 Test However some of our applications are rather big What we would like to do is First fix the most obvious deprecations that turn up in the dev bar Turn on the logging of deprecation errors to the server logs Read deprecation errors from the logs fix them Update to Symfony 3 Test For the first step the developer experience is rather good so thanks for that The 3th and 4th step should also be no problem My problem is with the second step logging them When the initial deprecations were added all deprecations were logged and people ran out of diskspace The logging should clearly not be on by default But right now they have been turned off rather rigorously How can we still log them to the server log Solution 1 By adding a user land error handler The first thing I tried was to add a user land error handler It is rather easy to do this see this gist When I do this suddenly all deprecation logs dissapear from the toolbar After a bit of tracing I found that the DebugHandlersListener only injects the logger if the current handler is an error handler Relevant links to source injecting logger L73 L92 injecting exception handler L113 L117 also injecting exception handler L59 L62 Solution one would mean creating a bundle that mimicks the behaviour of the DebugHandlersListener to inject the logger into my error handler so it can forward it to the one from Symfony It would also mean that everyone updating a large app has to reinvent this wheel Solution 2 Solving it in Symfony What if we would add an option to the framework bundle or another log deprecations Which could then do something similar to this gist This would give me the level of DX that I would expect from Symfony Solution 3 Reinstating the ErrorsLoggerListener The now deprecated ErrorsLoggerListener injected L42 L45 the logger in a way that makes it possible to replace the error handler Solution 4 The one I have missed Searching for everything in the 30 page upgrade guide is not really an option for us Our code coverage is increasing so the PHPUnit deprecations help But that alone does not give us enough confidence to upgrade The upgrade guide make your code deprecation free only offers the simple approach here What is the best way to log the deprecation notices server side If something already exists that would be awesome If someone proposes a possible Symfony side solution I would be willing to work towards a PR for the 2 8 or 2 7 branch,,"jameshalsall,xabbuh,lyrixx",2016-02-19 16:30:37,2016-09-28 07:50:57

IS,DependencyInjection Slow performance when merging parameter bags,The pull request to allow injecting ENV parameters introduced an issue when building the container When a container is merged the mergeEnvPlaceholders will duplicate existing placeholders In a local project where I had 9 env parameters this meant that the first 3 were duplicated 32768 times Later when the compiler calls resolveEnvPlaceholders it will loop through all of these impacting performance pretty badly I think the problem is that using array merge recursive will append duplicate values of nested arrays if the keys are numeric I have never contributed to Symfony before so I'm not sure on this one but I do not know if it needs to be fully recursive given that the environment placeholders should be scalar values If it really does need to be recursive then something like the function mentioned 92195 in the comments for the array merge recursive docs page could be used I did a simple performance check microtime for one of the compiler passes that was slowing down ContainerBuilderDebugDumpPass I will create a pull request using the simple merge and see what you think I guess this wo not affect anything before v3 2,,fabpot,2016-10-11 03:22:38,2016-10-11 15:16:51

IS,Can Symfony do this Render only existing relations in a Collection form and allow adding new relations for already existing items,So I have been struggling for the past 4 days with this and I am not sure if it is possible with Symfony or if I need to intervene with a custom fix I feel like this is a common widget used through applications and it could be pretty simple to do but I am missing the point on how to do it The idea is to add already existing Products to a new Order in a form The Products are already in the database they just need to be brought in the frontend To do this a text field that searches them by name returns a clickable drop down list and on clicking one item from the list the Product is added to the Order With this no new Products should be created The problem is that I want only the existing relations to be initially displayed and not all of the Products from the database Now what I have tried so far image This will render radio containing ALL products for each relation I can add new products to the order thanks to the CollectionType but the initial relations show all products as radio list for each relation If only I could somehow tell EntityType to only render the current relation Is there a way to do this,,xabbuh,2016-10-11 07:37:30,2016-10-11 20:00:56

IS,Cache cannot distinguish between OPTIONS and GET,Hello I just ran into an issue with Symfony 3 1 5 concerning the HttpCache mechanism which sends back the content of a GET method while executing an OPTIONS call I have a JS application which calls an API This app uses CORS preflight OPTIONS calls to determine if he can call the API Cache is configured on some public APIs On a basic example here is what happens OPTIONS call from the JS app returns the right Response with headers such as access control allow methods GET and cache control no cache if I do it multiple times using Postman it always generates a new Response with the expected content so that I am sure it is not cached GET call issued just after returns a Response with headers such as cache control max age 86400 public s maxage 86400 this one is being cached by HttpCache which stores it in a file on the server But when another computer accesses the page the OPTIONS call returns a cached Response with cache control max age 86400 public s maxage 86400 I found that because the Store generateCacheKey method only uses the Uri to compute the cache the key then HttpCache thinks it has found a cached version of the OPTIONS call and sends back the headers and body of the GET call instead I think the generateCacheKey should at least use the method when computing the key and maybe headers like Accept,,"stof,dmaicher,xabbuh,dmaicher,dunglas,dmaicher,teohhanhui,xabbuh,teohhanhui",2016-10-11 14:52:23,2016-10-14 01:29:09

IS,Symfony ClassLoader fails on Google App Engine,Symfony dies with the following error PHP Fatal error Fail to create and change permission of temporary file vfs in base data home runtimes php sdk google appengine runtime SplOverride php on line 178 The class loader component uses realpath which is not supported on Google App Engine Additionally realpath does not support stream wrappers which are necessary to get Symfony working on GAE The cache dir for GAE Symfony installations is something along the lines of gs but this gets completely erased when run through realpath which is why the extra slashes appear in the path to classes php After debugging the error appears to be caused by line 62 of CollectionClassLoader Commenting this line out makes Symfony work on GAE but obviously is not the right solution here L62 I suppose the proper solution here would be to make the ClassLoader component work properly with stream wrappers,,,2016-10-18 21:55:19,2016-10-27 15:38:27

IS,Filesystem LockHandler fallback directory should be configurable,Currently there is no way in Symfony to configure the fallback directory for the LockHandler when deploying a third party Symfony based app Unless the developer has hard coded a specific directory in the constructor calls the LockHandler will fall back on the system is temporary directory as provided by sys get temp dir This can lead to problems in some shared hosting configurations when sys get temp dir does not provide a useful value and the corresponding php ini directive sys temp dir cannot be configured by the user That may sound like a fringe scenario but I know of one fairly big European provider that uses the following setup on their shared servers sys get temp dir defaults to tmp because sys temp dir has no value assigned to it AND PHP is blocked from writing to tmp for security reasons Currently the only way to adapt a third party Symfony based app to such a setup is to hack the source code e g by replacing sys get temp dir with some absolute path or by setting the TMP TEMP and TMPDIR environment variables at runtime It would be much easier if a fallback directory for the LockHandler could be specified centrally in a Symfony configuration file The LockHandler could then use the following fallback sequence 1 Use any directory passed in the constructor call 2 Otherwise use any directory specified in the configuration file 3 Otherwise use sys get temp dir to get the system is default temporary directory To be clear I'm not expecting Symfony to anticipate every weird server setup What I'm saying is that since the usability of sys get temp dir depends on the server setup and precisely because Symfony cannot anticipate all possible server setups it should provide a way of configuring a fallback directory in case sys get temp dir fails,,"xabbuh,javiereguiluz,nicolas-grekas,lyrixx,nicolas-grekas,lyrixx,javiereguiluz,javiereguiluz,javiereguiluz",2016-11-06 11:24:22,2016-11-21 10:59:31

IS,Validator In strict mode email validator inaccurately claims certain valid emails are invalid,Symfony is email validation constraint symfony src Symfony Component Validator Constraints EmailValidator php can be configured in one of two modes Non strict mode default will cause the validator to compare an email address against a trivial ' S S ' regex It is sufficient for most traditional email addresses Strict mode on the other hand delegates validation to an external library Egulias EmailValidator which provides complex validation against the guidelines defined mostly in RFC 5321 and RFC 5322 This external library can also be run in strict vs non strict mode However in the context of this library strict means something very different than what it means in the context of Symfony is email validator More on that in a moment But for now realize that Symfony is email validator chooses to run the external library in strict mode Consider the following code that demonstrates the bug Please pardon the inline HTML Its output can be seen here Note that each email address shown is valid per the RFCs In the Symfony validator Non strict validation column the validation failures are not unexpected since the simple regex cannot possibly account for every variety of valid email address However in the Symfony validator Strict validation column we would expect that the validator would judge each of the listed email addresses as valid since a each address is valid per the RFCs and b we have delegated this validation to a library designed to use the RFC standards to validate emails As you can see some of the more strange uncommon yet still legitimate email addresses are inaccurately judged by Symfony as invalid The reason for this problem is that Symfony uses the Egulias EmailValidator library in strict mode rather than non strict mode In the context of the external library strict means Even if an email address is valid per the RFCs it will be considered invalid if any warnings non critical informational alerts were raised during the parsing of the email address For example one such informational alert indicates the presence of a double quoted local part in the email address In general a warning will occur if the address contains deprecated elements has unusual elements but remains valid per RFC 5321 or meets RFC 5322 is broad definition of an email address but might not satisfy the definitions in older obsolete RFCs In the Egulias validator with strict false column you will see the results of invoking the external validator directly but in non strict mode rather than strict mode In my opinion the corresponding results are in line with how Symfony is validator should behave when Symfony is validator is used in strict mode To summarize currently Symfony is validator in non strict mode Validates against a simple regex Symfony is validator in strict mode Validates against standard RFC rules Uses external library in strict mode which results in the unnecessary flagging of legitimate email addresses as invalid Proposed solution 1 Symfony is validator in non strict mode Validates against a simple regex Symfony is validator in strict mode Validates against standard RFC rules Uses external library in non strict mode which wo not consider strange uncommon yet still legitimate emails as invalid Proposed solution 2 Symfony is validator in non strict mode Validate against a simple regex Symfony is validator in strict mode Validates against standard RFC rules An option will be added to the constraint class to allow client code to determine whether or not the external library should be used in strict or non strict mode For backwards compatibility this would default to using the library in strict mode I'm submitting a patch in line with proposed solution 1 because it seems like solution 2 would lead to an unnecessarily confusing constraint class potentially needing to juggle two different definitions of the word strict But if anyone feels differently or for that matter feels this should not even be considered a bug in the first place please let me know,,"nicolas-grekas,egulias,webmozart,webmozart,javiereguiluz,xabbuh",2016-03-13 22:27:53,2017-01-13 18:43:02

IS,Process Windows argument escaping is fragile,It is quite easy to break ProcessUtils escapeArgument on Windows because it does not follow all the various argument parsing rules I discovered this while working on Composer is XdebugHandler which restarts the process and needs a robust way to escape its passed in arguments and after much research came up with a single function Winbox Args escape L29 to handle this To illustrate the problems we can pass some contrived arguments to both escape functions and get php to print out its argv Given this composer json The unexpected path expansion is a simple logic error but the argument splitting colors red followed by cmd exe trying to run a program called blue highlights a more serious problem the escaped arguments are not totally self contained What is happening here is that quote is escaped as quote and while this will work fine on its own the odd number of double quotes may corrupt subsequent arguments In this case the escaped colors red blue is interpreted by cmd exe as an argument colors red followed by the special character which signifies a separate command blue See How cmd exe parses a command for more information The wiki at winbox args details the various hoops you have to go through to try and make this stuff work,,sstok,2016-09-20 20:09:10,2017-02-08 15:46:55

IS,DI Replace container injection by explicit service locators,In some cases there is no better way than injecting the container itself and use it as a service locator The issue then is that one can access any public service thus it is almost impossible to track service dependencies for such code I would like to propose a first class service locator concept with mandatory and explicit dependencies declaration Such code would have first to explicitly declare the list of services they need to get them through a dedicated container service locator really that would have access to them and only them We could then maybe deprecate injecting the main container directly and replace that by the possibility for such a service locator to return the service container when required though that would be a discouraged practice but could be required for e g container inspecting logics,,"nicolas-grekas,nicolas-grekas,stof,nicolas-grekas,javiereguiluz,stof,theofidry,nicolas-grekas,nicolas-grekas,nicolas-grekas,mnapoli,nicolas-grekas,mnapoli,unkind,chalasr,chalasr",2016-11-27 17:06:39,2017-02-13 14:18:29

IS,RFC Move tests out of the source and source out of the tests,The Source Often when I'm auto completing classes in my IDE I get the suggestion to use the Test file Project wide searches and Usage Finder always shows tests using the search key or method class etc KernelTestCase and WebTestCase are library dependencies in a test directory I'm working on adding some functional tests to a bundle and this gave me a problem I had to depend on the FrameworkBundle 2 3 for BC reasons but I could not depend on 2 3 because that one did not have the KernelTestCase yet so I needed 2 5 The Symptoms For applications the recommended location is in tests understanding the directory structure For Application bundles this seem to be Tests and the same goes for re usable bundles directory structure The current setup with the recommendations and implementations cause a few issues I need to load files from the vendor Tests in order to run my tests I get vendor test files which I can autoload and depend on 2 different recommendations for test locations I cannot easily exclude them from the distributed version The Solution Personally I always put my code in bundles in the src directory this gives me a clean root directory and my tests in test This leaves the root directory for all the meta information for your package example So my suggestion is Extract the WebTestCase and KernelTestCase to another component PhpunitBridge where they can reside in the source instead of test location Exclude the tests from the archive archive Not put the source in the package root but in src like suggested for applications Not going to happen due to subtree split Put tests in test or tests where they have an autoload dev so they cannot be loaded in production code This will create a clearer structure where your source is not polluted by the tests and you cannot put anything of your public api in your tests like the TestCases When the test cases are moved out I can also require 2 3 or higher instead of 2 5 and higher thus 2 7,,"iltar,dosten,iltar,jakzal,sstok,iltar,Tobion,robfrawley,iltar,nicolas-grekas,nicolas-grekas,nicolas-grekas,Tobion,nicolas-grekas,iltar,Slamdunk,Slamdunk,nicolas-grekas,stof,nicolas-grekas,nicolas-grekas,iltar,nicolas-grekas,iltar,javiereguiluz,stof",2016-02-10 14:37:09,2017-02-17 10:19:43

PR,Routing Optimised dumped matcher,Q A Branch master Bug fix no New feature no BC breaks no Deprecations no Tests pass yes Fixed tickets License MIT Doc PR TL DR I have optimised the PhpMatcherDumper output for a del 60x del 4 4x performance improvement on a collection of 800 routes by inducing cyclomatic complexity EDIT The 60x performance boost was only visible when profiling with blackfire which is quite possibly a result of the cost of profiling playing a part After doing some more profiling the realistic benefit of the optimisation is more likely to be in the ranges is 1 3x to 4 4x After the previous optimisation I began looking at how the PrefixCollection was adding its performance boost I spotted another way to do this which has the same theory behind it excluding groups based on prefixes The current implementation only groups when one prefix resides in the other In this new implementation I have created a way to detect common prefixes which allows for much more efficient grouping Every time a route is added to the group it will either merge into an existing group merge into a new group with a route that has a common prefix or merge into a new group with an existing group that has a common prefix However when a parameter is present grouping must only be done AFTER that route this case is accounted for In all other cases where there is no collision routes can be grouped freely because if a group was matched other groups would not have matched After all the groups are created the groups are optimised Groups with fewer than 3 children are inlined into the parent group This is because a group with 2 children would potentially result in 3 prefix checks while if they are inlines it is 2 checks Like with the previous optimisation I have profiled this using blackfire But the match function did not show up anymore I have added usleep calls in the dumped matcher during profiling which made it show up again I have verified with that this is because the wall time of the function was too small for it to be of any interest When it DID get detected because of more tasks running it would show up with around 250 nanoseconds In comparison the previous speed improvement brought the wall time down from 7ms to 2 5ms on a set of 800 routes Because of the altered grouping behaviour I have not modified the PrefixCollection but I have created a new StaticPrefixCollection and updated the PhpMatcherDumper to use that instead,,"frankdejonge,stof,stof,stof,stof,stof,stof,stof,stof,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,fabpot,fabpot,fabpot,fabpot,fabpot,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,stof,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,stof,frankdejonge,stof,frankdejonge,arnaud-lb,frankdejonge,stof,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,fabpot,frankdejonge,Tobion,frankdejonge,dmaicher,dmaicher,frankdejonge,dmaicher,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,dmaicher,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,dmaicher,frankdejonge,dmaicher,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,dmaicher,dmaicher,frankdejonge,dmaicher,frankdejonge,frankdejonge,dmaicher,frankdejonge,nicolas-grekas,dmaicher,fabpot",2017-03-08 10:51:38,2017-03-22 19:46:17

IS,Request should not trust any header names by default,also see symfony symfony docs 7045 and talk about trusting proxies and but what if the ip of my reverse proxy changes constantly in particular mentions AWS as an example AWS ELBs do not set a Forwarded header making it necessary to follow the instructions at my reverse proxy sends x forwarded for but does not filter the forwarded header but they also do not set an X Forwarded Host only For Port and Proto which means that for a very popular use case running on AWS or products that build on it e g Heroku applications would be vulnerable to spoofing of those headers My hunch is that a lot of developers do not realize that they need to explicitly distrust these headers especially as the special case documentation and handling logic for Forwarded unlike the other headers has been introduced relatively recently I propose that out of the box when a developer calls Request setTrustedProxies no header names are trusted by default and they must always be explicitly opted into using Request setTrustedHeaderName That is only slightly more work but means that the default is safe with an empty whitelist and developers having to investigate what headers really are being set in their environment are much more likely to end up with valid settings that do not compromise application security cc who asked me to open this issue I may have time for a PR soon ish,,"nicolas-grekas,fabpot,nicolas-grekas,robfrawley,nicolas-grekas",2016-10-06 19:10:16,2017-04-03 23:22:30

IS,Environment variables get REDIRECT appended in prod but not dev,Q A Bug report yes Feature request no BC Break report no RFC no Symfony version 3 2 0 When using an environment variable set by Apache if it is coming from a redirect like in the case of a user login it adds REDIRECT to the variable name in prod but not dev To test this out 1 Set up the following in security yml 2 Leave the default route and set up an extra route for admin 3 Set up a route for symfonylogin and do a print r SERVER to dump all environment variables directly from PHP 4 In web htaccess add a line with the following SetEnv REMOTE USER adminblah Now if you were to go to site app dev php admin it would redirect you to symfonylogin and print the environment variables You will see that there is a REMOTE USER variable but no REDIRECT REMOTE USER variable If you then go to site admin to see the prod version it will have a variable REDIRECT REMOTE USER as well Note that in our case the only reason that REMOTE USER is also there is because it is being set every time a page loads including when loading symfonylogin When an external source is setting this you only get the REDIRECT REMOTE USER variable Because we are pulling this directly from the PHP variable SERVER I thought it was a PHP thing but the fact that it only does it when you load the prod environment and not dev means it has to be Symfony doing this This should be set up the same between prod and dev as it makes development very hard if the 2 environments act so differently I would suggest changing the behavior of the dev environment to match production,,xabbuh,2016-12-15 23:00:29,2017-04-14 09:55:25

IS,EventDispatcher quo vadis listener priorities,Q A Bug report no Feature request yes BC Break report yes no RFC yes no Symfony version 3 3 I am wondering about Symfony 4 which in turn might require some deprecations for 3 3 and how to deal with priorities The current number system creates very implicit dependencies between listeners that are quite fragile to deal with See for example this PR on FOSRestBundle that is the continuation of various previous attempts to extend Symfony core behavior The fundamental question to me is 1 keep the priority system ie implicit dependencies 2 replace it with a system allowing definition of explicit dependencies 3 remove priorities without a replacement About 1 I find the current approach to lead to hard to debug code especially when Bundles are trying to extend core behavior It gets worse when multiple Bundles attempt to extend the same core listener About 2 I think we have debated explicit dependencies between listeners at various points already and dropped it due to concerns over the complexity in building the dependency graphs etc I guess in theory maybe composer code could be used here but maybe that is overkill I guess performance could be handled via caching similar to what we do with the DI Container But either way it would be a lot of code to write About 3 This would be the most radical step Essentially this would mean that listeners that depend on each other would need to be chained together explicitly That is we might want to then offer some sort of chain listener If I would want to create a dependency between two listeners I would therefore have to de register the existing listener and replace it with a chain listener that is then configured to execute the given listeners in the required order This approach would basically make dependencies explicit but would rely on the user to handle this explicitly The advantage being that it would be less code to write and maintain on our side but it would make it harder to solve situations of multiple re useable bundles wanting to extend the same core listener,,"lsmith77,lsmith77,ro0NL,javiereguiluz,jakzal,lsmith77,jakzal,javiereguiluz,stof,Pierstoval,lsmith77,stof,dunglas,lsmith77,lsmith77,dunglas,lsmith77",2017-04-24 18:03:10,2017-04-28 07:20:07

IS,DI Fully support PHP constants,Q A Bug report no Feature request yes well yes and no actually BC Break report no RFC no well yes and no actually Symfony version 3 4 Actually the DI component has a limited support of PHP constants e g in xml you can use argument type constant FOO argument So far so good But then it is resolved and thus when dumped if my constant has a bar value will not appear as FOO as expected but as bar note the s Thus if you compile the container on a say build machine deploy the generated code to several other machines and want to tweak the constant e g a DEBUG STATUS constant on a signle machine as it is already resolved on the build machine you will never be able the tweak said value without having to rebuild the container which you may not be able to on said machine think as if it is somebody else wanting to do the task not having a clue that you have to do something other than tweaking the constant A solution could be to either support in the Definition Or maybe like the closure proxy arguments through ClosureProxyArgument class the constants and thus when dumped just dumps the constant name or use a placeholder like in the env behavior If it were up to me I think the first solution would be more elegant and could pass the config too see 22594,,"Taluu,fabpot,Taluu,fabpot",2017-05-01 16:34:24,2017-05-01 18:33:06
IS,Add option of entity or bundle when doing doctrine schema create,Q A Bug report no Feature request yes BC Break report no RFC yes Symfony version N A I wanted to look at what sql was being run in a bundle I was installing and so used php bin console doctrine schema create dump sql This came up with a lot of SQL and in some cases it would be nice to be able to just create or update one entity or entities under 1 bundle When I looked into it there is the option of using one entity manager but that generally is not going to help with vendor bundles etc So it would be nice to get an option on the console command for schema create or schema update to select just one entity or any entity within a bundle I understand that the bundle option may be hard to do but if we could just do it by one or maybe a number of entities we could just look in the bundle at the entity names So then we could do something like php bin console doctrine schema create dump sql entities entity1 entity2 and narrow down which entities are affected Not sure if this would be a Symfony feature or if it would need to be added in Doctrine first,,"xabbuh,javiereguiluz",2017-05-02 00:12:34,2017-05-02 05:31:37

IS,RFC Discussing the requirement of components bridges and bundles in the 3 4 branch,changed the constraints in the 3 4 branch to allow 4 0 x version of the other components After that I had a lengthy discussion with grekas on Slack challenging it We now think it is time to share our thoughts outside the core team and with core team members not connected at this time to involve the whole community Note for the whole discussion I will talk about components but this also applies to bridges and bundles developed in the symfony symfony repo It is just shorter than repeating components bridges and bundles all the time The whole point of this discussion is to decide how the requirements of the of inter component dependencies should look like in the 3 4 branch There is 3 possible options 1 3 2 not allowing any usage of 4 x dependencies 2 3 2 4 0 0 allowing only the 4 0 x versions of deps but not 4 1 what 22742 did and what we did for 2 8 as well 3 3 2 4 0 allowing the whole 4 x releases relying on the BC promise of 4 x Note example above assume that the lowest bound of the existing 3 3 constraint is 3 2 It can be something else for each requirement so things should be adapted above accordingly The third option was rejected by grekas because it hurts our promise that the Symfony code will never trigger deprecations by itself i e calling a non deprecated API from your own code does not make Symfony call a deprecated API internally on its own as it precisely relies on BC layers I'm arguing that we should stick with the first option because of the way Composer works and because of our ecosystem change with Flex Regarding Composer what you need to remember is how it chooses the installed version it always selects the highest version available which matches your constraints So if you require 3 2 4 0 0 it will always try to use a 4 0 x release first This has 2 drawbacks 4 0 brings BC breaks this is why it is named 4 4 0 x is not a LTS version meaning it will go unmaintained much before 3 4 Regarding the ecosystem change the big difference is what Symfony users will tell Composer when they want to use our 3 4 LTS version because they have not yet migrated their code to 4 x APIs for instance in the symfony standard way they would tell Give me Symfony 3 4 i e composer require symfony symfony 3 4 and they would get the 3 4 version of the whole Symfony code in the flex way they would tell Give me FrameworkBundle 3 4 i e composer require symfony framework bundle 3 4 and they would expect to get 3 4 version of Symfony But the options above may break this assumption What is important to remember is that people using symfony framework bundle as a dependency actually spend most of their time interacting with transitive dependencies brought in by FrameworkBundle they write route definitions symfony router they write controllers symfony http kernel they handle requests and responses in their controller symfony http foundation they write service definitions symfony dependency injection they trigger or listen to events symfony event dispatcher If we go with the option 2 a new Symfony 3 4 project would automatically get the 4 0 version of all the components I listed just above and a few others until another rule forbids to use version 4 and this is very bad because it means people will not receive BC layers anymore which basically breaks our BC promise Note FrameworkBundle is not the only package having mandatory requirements on other Symfony packages but it was the best example for this case as it is the entry point of using Symfony in Flex This could also affect external projects relying on Symfony components as they could also be relying on transitive deps symfony http kernel bringing in symfony http foundation Note Things can become even worse if symfony framework bundle removes the explicit require on symfony http foundation and relies on symfony http kernel bring it to the user instead as bring in 4 0 x for HttpKernel then allows bring in any 4 x version for HttpFoundation which goes to option 3 I only see 2 ways to avoid this issue stick to option 1 meaning that a dependency between Symfony components cannot require a higher major version than the current one allowing lower major versions of them is fine and 4 x components should actually all allow 3 4 version of their deps as the 3 4 version will have all the features they need teach people to never rely on transitive deps for the packages they directly use in their project which means that the Symfony skeleton should list much more packages by default duplicating the FrameworkBundle deps without allowing 4 0 x Due to the effect on DX I strongly suggest sticking to option 1 But the call is now on the community to decide about option 1 2 or 3 above Note that for dev requirements we should allow bringing in 4 0 versions unless we also have a conflict rule forbidding them because this helps ensuring that users do not end up in non working cases as optional deps cannot be enforced to stay on 3 x if we do not have conflict rules forbidding them as we do not control the requirement bringing them

IS,3 3 Glob loader breaks loading inline YAML resources,Q A Bug report yes Feature request no BC Break report yes RFC no Symfony version 3 3 0 RC1 First of all I'm not sure if this is issue or if this just should not be done this way Upgrading to Symfony 3 3 0 RC1 in Sylius causes an error as indicated in Sylius Sylius 7896 After additional investigation I figured this is caused due to Sylius using a custom loader to load config files with inline YAML as a resource example shortened The custom loader generates routes based on the configuration given in the resource key so it is a nice way to avoid writing lots of boilerplate code for the same thing over and over Using the resource key also reduces the amount of files needed without this there would have to be one routing file and another file containing the actual specification now contained in resource With this comes the issue the introduction of glob loaders in 21635 broke this completely while 22621 partially fixed it it no longer breaks for config files that do not contain any of the characters triggering the glob loader removing the except directive in the config above fixes the error for this file Would you consider this a valid use case of the resource key in a config file If so should the check for the glob pattern be hardened In this case adding a check against newlines would help but who knows what else is out there Another option would be to fall back to the default behavior if the glob loader did not load anything but I'm also not sure what side effects this might have Last but not least this could also be fixed on the Sylius side I just wanted to check here before doing that,,"alcaeus,nicolas-grekas,alcaeus,xabbuh,nicolas-grekas,xabbuh,nicolas-grekas,alcaeus,xabbuh",2017-05-29 05:53:49,2017-05-29 18:41:17

PR,Fix the conditional definition of the SymfonyTestsListener,Q A Branch 3 3 Bug fix yes New feature no BC breaks no Deprecations no Tests pass yes Fixed tickets n a License MIT Doc PR n a This is a continuation of the attempts at fixing the PHPUnit 5 compatibility layer for the listener The signature mismatch error still happened when using the PHPUnit PHAR instead of a source install hint people using simple phpunit are using a source install It looks like the class definition gets loaded by PHP before executing the code placed above it and so the early return breaks Putting the code inside a else instead works fine the class definition probably cannot bubble up The known difference between the PHAR and a source install is that the source install relies on autoloading while the PHAR loads all PHPUnit classes through require once eagerly and so the parent class already exists when using the Symfony file is it an expected behavior that early returns before class definitions do not work consistently Regarding the patch itself an alternative would be to move the PHPUnit 6 implementation to a dedicated class instead and use a class alias for the else clause too But I do not think it is worth it,,"stof,nicolas-grekas,stof,jpauli,stof,fabpot,stof,nicolas-grekas,stof,jpauli,stof,stof,nicolas-grekas,jpauli,stof",2017-06-12 13:48:32,2017-06-12 14:56:30

IS,Translator Resource loading order depends on kernel debug setting,Q A Bug report yes Feature request no BC Break report no RFC no Symfony version 2 8 more precisely problem exists since 2 7 In 027a7477361eee9d40157bee714602a820e59b18 13897 was merged This was a performance improvement Instead of calling the expensive Translator addResource method when creating the Translator instance in the DIC only an array of resources would be passed to Translator construct Translator loadResources would then iterate over this array and make the actual addResource call but not unless Translator initializeCatalogue is called Then e36f1a70e19ff12caa208ff75087a76b7a2ffac1 tries to fix a bug with not reloading the messages It does so by adding another Translator loadResources call in Translator loadCatalogue but only does this in kernel debug mode assuming messages do not change in prod Then in aa70a9414688cc17ebcbcf3192b29aad6c67d21b this loadCatalogue overriden method was removed again and the loadResources if in debug code slipped into the constructor I admin that I cannot really follow the ideas behind all these changes However the bottom line is that in kernel debug mode the resources passed to the constructor are turned into addResource calls immediately whereas in production mode this is deferred until initialize initializeCatalogue are called This is a problem for other bundles extensions that add additional resources to the Translator via addResource calls for example added to the DIC Depending on the kernel debug setting these resources will be loaded first or last which makes the resource override or lose against other message sources Assuming that message source priority should not change between debug and prod I see the following options a Always add resources passed in the resource files option in the constructor Probably defeats the initial performance improvement intention b Always defer adding resource files until initialize is called That way resources added via addResource by 3rd party bundles always have a lower priority than resource files c Change the private loadResources method in a way that shifts the resources before those added by addResource calls where they would end up if they were added in the constructor Additionally if in production it is no problem to defer this initialization until initialize is called why is it necessary to perform this step in the constructor under kernel debug Update Suggested fix in 23057,,"mpdude,mpdude,sstok,mpdude",2017-06-02 14:08:25,2017-06-14 20:11:16

IS,Form validation errors for camelCased entity properties are not mapped to the snake cased form fields,Q A Bug report no Feature request yes BC Break report no RFC no Symfony version 3 2 1 I use a form field using snake case while I use camelCase for the property name and for the getter and setter method for this property in the model When the form is submitted the data is mapped to the model properties the PropertyPathMapper uses the PropertyAccessor to set the value The PropertyAccessor uses a camelize method to find getters and setters for the property But when a validation error occurs on such a property it is not mapped back to the form field because the ViolationMapper compares the camelCased propertyPath of the model property with the snake cased propertyPath of the form field This may not be a bug and people should not use a form field with another name than the property when not explicitly using the property path option of the form field But I find it confusing that the mapping used for changing the model based on the form data works but mapping the validation errors back to the form field does not,,"HeahDude,xabbuh,xabbuh",2017-03-27 09:19:41,2017-06-21 15:16:45

IS,BrowserKit back forward behaviour not consistent with other browsers,I ve got an application that only allows you to visit a url once doing the same request again takes you elsewhere For example imagine a wizard or a purchase flow something like this Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 where between each step the user POSTs a form and gets redirected to the next page using a standard Post Redirect Get flow and the system is built so that going back forward unexpectedly in the flow should take me to step 1 For example browser back button should take me to step 1 browser back forward button should take me to step 1 When I m using BrowserKit to write a test for my application it does not seem to do the same thing as my browser does This is how my regular browser Chrome Firefox behaves with HTTP requests in parentheses 1 I visit the first page GET wizard view step 1 2 I submit my choices POST wizard complete step 1 3 I get redirected to the next page GET wizard view step 2 4 I submit my choices POST wizard complete step 2 5 I get redirected to the next page GET wizard view step 3 6 I click my browser is back button GET wizard view step 2 notice the skipping of the previous POST no 4 above and going directly to the last GET request no 3 above as per the Post Redirect Get pattern 7 I get redirected to the first page GET wizard view step 1 8 I click my browser is forward button GET wizard view step 3 notice that my browser still remembers the page I have already been to in the future and takes me there 9 I get redirected to the first page GET wizard view step 1 however When I do this with BrowserKit there are 2 major differences compared to my regular graphical browser A History back does not follow PRG Post Redirect Get flows correctly It only steps backwards 1 step in my history not skipping the POST requests that returned a redirect HTTP status 3xx B Being redirected differently when going back clears future history In BrowserKit assuming that I manually skip the POST requests when I go back no 6 above get redirected no 7 and then try to go forward again I get a LogicException with You are already on the last page Here is a simplified unit test for BrowserKit History to illustrate B above assuming we are keeping PRG flows out of the equation for now,,javiereguiluz,2016-10-03 16:12:39,2017-07-09 17:36:02

IS,Cookie toString is using urlencode instead of rawurlencode,Q A Bug report yes Feature request no BC Break report no RFC no Symfony version 3 2 I'm trying to pass an array from my backend to the frontend on a cookie To do this I'm converting the array to a stringified json object and passing that as the value on a Symfony Component HttpFoundation Cookie The frontend is then converting the string back to a json object using javascript is decodeURIComponent When the Cookie is stringified L148 and attached as a header on the response it is encoding the cookie value using urlencode which does not follow RFC 3986 instead of using rawurlencode which does follow RFC 3986 The difference is that spaces are encoded as instead of 20 The decodeURIComponent adheres to RFC 3986 meaning that when I decode the cookie I then have to parse the values to replace s with spaces which obviously is not ideal Is there a reason that it is using urlencode instead of rawurlencode Off the top of my head I can not think of why it would be necessary but it is possible I'm missing something I would be happy to change it and submit a PR but I wanted to get others' thoughts and input,,,2017-06-21 17:47:46,2017-07-11 14:37:00

IS,Clearing the cache fails because the cache is outdated,There is a cyclic dependency between the cache clear command and the cached service container itself causing it to sometimes fail when the services are adjusted In order to reproduce this consider these steps 1 Create a normal Symfony setup 2 Create a command using dependency injection i e services yml or similar 3 Run that command This will cause the cached service container to be created 4 Adjust the command added in step 2 so that it takes an additional parameter e g the logger 5 Run app console cache clear At this point you get a ContextErrorException which is caused by loading the cached service container and retrieving the command defined in step 2 Since the cache is outdated it does not provide the new parameter added in step 4 At this point you are basically SOL with builtin tools you have to manually delete the cache folders A variation of this is when extending setContainer in a container aware command to retrieve the dependencies The idea is to override setContainer call the baseclass first and then retrieve your own dependencies Similar to the variant using dependency injection this fails when setContainer is called based on an outdated service container cache I have tried to hack around this and was able to at least get the setContainer based approach running In class Symfony Bundle FrameworkBundle Console Application I removed the loop calling setContainer on the commands Instead I only called this registerCommands in that place In the baseclass Symfony Component Console Application I called command setContainer this getKernel getContainer on the invoked command Of course this does not work reliably because I'm simply assuming that the derived class has a kernel with a container it is just a proof of concept hack Some more notes Why are unused commands retrieved from the service container at all A much better approach would seem to just locate the one command that is called so that issues with other commands do not cause complete failure Loading an initializing all other commands seems like a waste of CPU to me Another approach would be to log and ignore failure to register commands This could allow commands to veto their registration It would also cause the variant using dependency injection to not fail fatally when just one dependency is temporarily broken I'm using Symfony 2 8 on Debian,,"iltar,stof,stof,iltar,javiereguiluz",2016-07-26 08:22:45,2017-07-17 07:29:48

IS,Injecting dependencies and using Phpunit mocks after 3 2 deprecation,Q A Bug report no Feature request yes BC Break report no RFC no Symfony version 3 2 0 With 3 2 this kind of approach to functional testing and mocking was deprecated There is currently no clear replacement for this that does not require a lot of rewrites Take this example You have an application that lists products It consists of a controller a product repository and a database connection The repository uses the database connection to list products We would like to write some functional tests that test two scenarios there are no products and there are products We already have unit tests for our repository with a mocked database connection test database We need to change the behavior of the repository on a per test basis We have two options as I see it unit testing the controller and replacing the class in the test environments config file If we have all our controllers registered as services inject all dependencies into them and do not access the container from the controller we can simply create an instance of the controller with phpunit mocked dependencies and unit test it This is not a fully functional test and symfony is never booted No events will be run for example The other option is to create a RepositoryMock class that extends the Repository or implements a common interface and has a setData method and overrides the other methods in the original class With this approach we can use client self createClient and client getContainer get arepository' setData in the test before making the request This takes some work as you have to manually mock all classes and figure out a way to change their behavior with a call to public methods We can not use phpunit mocks here as it is not possible to replace the entire object in the container There might be a third option that is what I'm trying to get to here The issue with the method that was deprecated is the at that stage in the execution there is no guarantee that the object has not already been used It would be nice if you could replace objects in the container configuration when creating the container before any of the objects have been used Take a look at this example The createClient method takes an options array We pass in the services we want to override to it so that it can be passed along when booting the kernel and can be loaded when the container is created Would this be possible Are there any issues with this that I'm overlooking I think this approach could potentially make testing easier and cleaner,,"chalasr,chalasr,nicolas-grekas,nicolas-grekas",2017-06-28 06:07:53,2017-07-21 08:04:52

IS,DI Add a new PHP fluent format for configuring the container,Q A Bug report no Feature request yes BC Break report no RFC yes Symfony version 3 3 or 4 0 How about adding a new configuration format for the dependency injection container TL DR Short version YAML and XML suck in their own ways We are PHP developers we know how to write PHP code and we have all the tools we need around PHP Let is write configuration in PHP That does not have to be verbose or boring on the contrary it is possible to improve the developer experience A possible solution is detailed at the end The main idea is to take the best from YAML XML and PHP and imagine a new and better configuration format Intro The current formats YAML XML PHP API of the container To be clear I'm suggesting adding a 4th format 3 options is already a lot adding a 4th is maybe not the best But I think we can write a new format that is better than these 3 formats altogether I believe that new format could replace all other 3 eventually At first the new format could be tagged as experimental Why The downsides of the existing formats YAML YAML is easy to read but error prone to write indentation issues arrays in arrays in objects in array YAML is just a data structure adding behavior requires hacking up the format and inventing a custom language on top of it service name for service references param name for parameters env for environment variables app mailer for optional injection requires using the expression language for doing basic logic that could be done in PHP service 'mailer configuration' getMailerMethod etc YAML config starts to look like Lisp or regexps with all the special characters no autocompletion of the YAML API available e g should I type decorate or decorates no documentation of the YAML API in IDEs e g wondering what does autowiring types do there is no phpdoc for that you have to go find it in the online documentation no static analysis of the PHP items e g recognize if you type a class name that does not exist refactoring support autocompletion both last points are partially addressed by IDE plugins like the amazing Symfony plugin for PhpStorm the Symfony plugin still comes with issues a huge part of the IDE tooling around Symfony relies on one developer which is very fragile it is written in Java obviously which can explain why there are so few contributors yet so many users in general all those plugins come with the root issue that they are extremely complicated since they have to support a whole configuration language with a lot of options there is also no native YAML reader in PHP forcing to require symfony yaml This is also why the XML format is encouraged for open source bundles leading to 2 different formats being recommended XML XML has the benefit of being more strict and benefit from validation IDE helpers but verbose and harder to read which is probably why YAML is preferred in the community hard to type without an IDE while there can be autocompletion of XML items tags attributes etc thanks to the XSD there is still no static analysis of PHP items here too e g recognize if you type a class name that does not exist refactoring support autocompletion The point about IDE plugins made in the YAML section still stands PHP By PHP I mean the PHP API of the Container class for example as a reminder Just an idea for the implementation Disclaimer I would not be honest if I did not mention that most of these suggestions are based on PHP DI In version 3 it supported configuration formats very similar to Symfony YAML XML and PHP Starting from version 4 I dropped all these formats and instead switched to a PHP oriented format Since then I'm entirely convinced that that kind of format is much better in terms of developer experience I would love to see that kind of format land in Symfony Conclusion What do you think I want to make clear that all of these are suggestions and that all aspects are up for discussion In other words if you disagree with very specific syntax choices that is fine I'm mostly interested for now in whether or not such a big change is doable,,"mnapoli,iltar,sstok,iltar,Pierstoval,ro0NL,stof,iltar,Pierstoval,stof,stof,Pierstoval,stof,Pierstoval,stof,sstok,iltar,stof,robfrawley,Pierstoval,Taluu,stof,nicolas-grekas",2017-04-12 19:14:54,2017-09-20 13:08:57

IS,cache clear clears all kind of cache even the application one,Q A Bug report yes no not sure Feature request no BC Break report no RFC no Symfony version 3 1 Hello After some weird problem in production we just realized that using that running bin console cache clear removes all kind of cache even custom one defined by developper like using the RedisAdapter In my team we are splitted between it is normal and confusion This command has been around since Symfony 2 0 and I would have never excepted to have an undocumented impact on a cache component introduced in Symfony 3 1 My point is Symfony has his internal cache metadata cache var cache which is totally fine to clear when running cache clear command Symfony provides cache component in order to use it for our app needs so why when we need to clear internal Symfony cache var cache this command also earase all keys for our application cache I think it is a dangerous behaviour because By default in standard edition cache clear is called from post script in composer json So each time we deploy and run composer install It will remove all cache even if you do not want to This feature or bug p is not documented We deliver 5 20 times per day so we resolved this issue by no longer cache clear the application removing it from the composer script section that will lead all developpers to weird behaviour after adding some libraries because it wo not be done automatically Maybe I do not have the correct argument but can you please provide your point of view to what led you to this decision and how to keep our application cache while still have the possibility to delete internal symfony cache please do not tell me that we have to use another cache bundle to be able to achieve that it would be so much waste imho we should have a way to clear all internal symfony cache in a separate way from the cache we use for our application Thank you,,"nicolas-grekas,nicolas-grekas,nicolas-grekas,javiereguiluz,nicolas-grekas,robfrawley,nicolas-grekas,stof,nicolas-grekas,nicolas-grekas",2017-07-26 14:59:13,2017-10-01 16:49:56

IS,Using Workflow FrameworkBundle leads to error when triggering by type autowiring,Q A Bug report yes Feature request no BC Break report no RFC no Symfony version 3 3 6 I'm using some standalone parts of Symfony without using the full symfony symfony dependency This currently means that I'm using the FrameworkBundle and Workflow component But this leads to some complicated problem where compiling the container works fine but when checking if the container is still fresh it leads to an error being Uncaught exception 'ReflectionException' with message 'Class Symfony Component Security Core Authorization ExpressionLanguage not found' in var www symfony error vendor symfony workflow EventListener ExpressionLanguage php on line 22 After a lot of debugging I found out there are two possible issues which lead to this problem The first issue is the fact that the class is added as ClassExistsResource due to the now deprecated by type auto wiring This due to AutoWirePass populateAvailableType calling this container getReflectionClass which will add this class as resource because it did not exist or in this case could not be loaded But IMHO it is strange to add such class as resource because of the auto wiring As it means that classes which are not used in the compiled container which is the case for this ExpressionLanguage class the service for it does not exist as it is unused are still checked when checking if the container is still fresh While it is completely unsure whether such service would actually suffice to be used as auto wire argument which even most likely is the case in all of these scenarios that such missing class can not suffice as argument of a completely different service And I think this also means that all services which are defined will be checked whether the container is still fresh so either as ClassExistenceResource or as ReflectionClassResource even when they are not available in the compiled container Which will thus lead to a performance impact in those cases where every call checks if the container is still fresh so at least dev environment The second issue is in ClassExistenceResource where throwOnRequiredClass seems to fail For the i 1 array search autoloadFrame trace true line the array search is false in my case on PHP 5 6 so i will become 1 which in my case means that the actual spl autoload call is tested Furthermore if the check did work it would end up testing on the include call from Composer which would still mean that it would throw in this case To demonstrate the issue I have created a test project The first time the page will load fine and display loaded but when refreshing the page it gives a fatal error due to aboves exception As can be observed the ExpressionLanguage class is not present as service in the dumped container but it is present in the compiled containers meta file as ClassExistenceResource When changing the configuration of the Foo service by disabling auto wiring or creating a new Bar service matching the type of the argument it does work This because in that case the by type auto wiring is not triggered and thus the ExpressionLanguage class is not monitored for existence,,"chalasr,chalasr,nicolas-grekas,chalasr,jakzal,stof,nicolas-grekas",2017-08-22 10:51:39,2017-10-05 09:56:47

IS,RFC DI Decoupling through type mapping,The feature I will describe is meant to solve complex component coupling by using dynamic configuration assisted delegation and or decoration I dont know if the presented solution will be viable from different points of view but that is up to discussion here The solution reuses and extends concepts that are also applied on service autowiring and the feature itself may have been described before in other non php frameworks but I dont know of any and I came up with this solution while trying to solve problems similar to the ones described in The heart of the feature is the following function A deduct B b Z z which either returns an instance of type A wrapping the implementation of b throws an exception z is an optional implementation specific configuration format Z which can be used to construct such an instance of type A The easiest implementation of the given function is the one already used for autowiring if b instance of A then return b else throw exception Without the help of additional configuration provided by c another implemention may inspect method signatures the number of members method names type names and other type metadata How reliable the various metrics are has to be determined What could a type Z provide to make an implementation more flexible A simple way is to provide factories that do exactly the given transformation A wrap B b Not only can the implementation now provide an instance of A for each instance B but by building the transitive closure over the factories it can provide an instance of A for each instance C given that there is an additional factory B wrap C c Writing those factories and the delegates decorators used by them can be very repetitive but can also be automated if we can apply an a priori instruction in the config A is detuctable from B The developer explicitly states that there is a decoration delegation so a factory A wrap B b can be built Whether or not the algorithm used by the deduct implementation can actually achieve this or has to error out will be know at container compile time The configuration can be extended to also provide specific mappings for all or single members and or simple argument list transpositions How does this actually help us with decoupling Lets look at the Validator component it has a dependency to the Translation component because it uses its interface Symfony Component Translation TranslatorInterface at L149 Insteadof relying on another package is interface making it a direct dependency the Validator component could define its own interface Symfony Component Validator TranslatorInterface which is basically a copy of Symfony Component Translation TranslatorInterface but can also be reduced to just the methods needed for the Validator component and on service construction use the deduct function to get an instance of its own translator type from an already existing translator of the Translations components translator type I hope this makes the basic approach somewhat clear I wont go much further about possible implementations and evaluation of viable metrics until i have some feedback whether or not this approach is worth following,,"iltar,iltar,nicolas-grekas,jakzal,chalasr,jakzal",2016-03-15 20:23:09,2017-10-25 12:39:14

PR,HttpKernel HttpFoundation Prototype Service reset as middleware,Q A Branch 3 4 Bug fix yes New feature no BC breaks no Deprecations no Tests pass yes Fixed tickets 24552 24554 License MIT Doc PR N A This PR drafts an alternative approach to 24689 Problem The problem of 24552 is that 24155 introduced a behavior change of the kernel terminate event because services were reset after a request has been processed This caused issues with existing tests written with WebTestCase that tried to assert the state of certain services after a request Approach The idea behind the approach of this PR is that the affected services could very well be reset at the very beginning of a new request Because we reset the profiler that collects data from the event dispatcher we need to perform the reset before the event dispatcher is used for the first time Since Symfony does not have a proper extension point for this kind of functionality I propose to add the service reset as a middleware between Kernel and HttpKernel making it transparent to both of them Alternatives 24689 also resets services at the beginning of a new request but does so by decorating RequestStack which so far only was a plain and simple data structure That PR would introduce a somewhat unexpected side effect A simpler low impact alternative would be to convert the current ServiceResetListener into a regular public service that is directly being called by Kernel handle This would avoid the middleware but would allow us to easily refactor the feature into a middleware if we decide to introduce that concept later,,"derrabus,stof,derrabus,derrabus,nicolas-grekas,derrabus,nicolas-grekas,nicolas-grekas",2017-10-26 13:04:27,2017-10-28 14:40:59

IS,Form Sometimes checking for form parent view in Twig is wrong,Q A Bug report yes Feature request no BC Break report no RFC no Symfony version 2 7 Hi there This morning I faced an issue in EasyAdminBundle related to form themes and form parent check in Twig Briefly the problem happen if we have a simple form with a field named parent The situation gets worse depending on whether the parent field has children or not First let is see the FormView class especially the parent property and ArrayAccess methods L19 L126 In PHP context there is no problem the main form view has the form parent property and its children is fields form 'parent' each one accessible unmistakably by syntax But in Twig context this access check if form parent is null empty causes a naming collision The parent attribute is resolved by Twig following the steps below variables For convenience is sake form parent does the following things on the PHP layer check if form is an array and parent a valid element L1437 L1445 always wins in this particular case if not and if form is an object check that parent is a valid property never reached if not and if form is an object check that getParent is a valid method Therefore the parent child field view is returned instead of the real parent view which is null in this case There is some place in the source where this kind of check is done and surely in many bundles and apps form parent I'm not sure if there is a workaround for current projects bundles rely on the Symfony form themes templates I do not think it is a bug of Twig either but a design error of the FormView class which is specially designed to work in Twig context We may need a getter method for this parent property by now and check if form getParent everywhere avoiding the first rule Wdyt thoughts,,"yceruto,xabbuh,yceruto",2017-11-10 01:04:44,2017-11-10 07:06:50

IS,Intl Component Directory Traversal Script Execution via locale Value,Q A Bug report yes Feature request yes BC Break report no RFC no Symfony version 3 3 The Intl component includes various bundle readers e g PhpBundleReader JsonBundleReader etc used to read resource bundles from the local filesystem The read APIs for these classes accept a path argument to the directory where the bundles are located and a locale argument specifying which language bundle to retrieve The read API simply appends the locale string to the path string adds the appropriate suffix e g php json etc and returns the data from the file The locale value is commonly retrieved from the untrusted query string and if not validated sanitized will lead to directory traversal attacks as an attacker can navigate to arbitrary directories via the dot dot slash attack This is especially problematic when using the PhpBundleReader since the PHP file is executed via an include statement allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP files on the system Consider the example excerpt below demonstrating a vulnerable example where the locale retrieved from the query can be used to execute arbitrary PHP files Optimally the read APIs should sanitize the locale argument to prevent directory traversal attacks At a minimum a warning should be added to the Intl documentation stating that the locale will be appended to the path value and should be sanitized appropriately to prevent directory traversal attacks,,"javiereguiluz,xabbuh",2017-08-31 17:25:31,2017-11-17 08:08:15

max length' shortLabel NotBlank message 'back country validation short label not blank' Length max 32 maxMessage 'back country validation short label max length' In attached Country form there are two non required fields chief and contactPerson which are of type User that is extended entity of FOSUser entity I use EntityType to load these users to selectbox If there is any user set as chief or contactPerson and I want to unset them I simply select empty value chief null or contactPerson null is then sent over the POST request But even if request is passed to the form handleRequest request method chief or contactPerson will remain unchanged in state before editation This shoud works according to documentation so I started to debug I opened Forms tab in the Profiler For country chief or country contactPerson form attributes under the submitted data section there was correctly Key Value View Format Normalized Format null Model Format same as normalized format But if I look directly into the country form instead of country chief or country contactPerson I saw Key Value View Format same as normalized format Normalized Format Country id 1 label Label changed shortLabel Short label chief User contactPerson User Model Format same as normalized format This is not correct why value in the first table is correctly unset and same attribute in the entity is set to original user So after few hours of debugging I discovered following bug in UniqueEntityValidator php I use UniqueEntityValidator for validating uniqueness of label and shortLabel it can be seen in snippet above If debugging cursor stepped from Symfony Bridge Doctrine Validator Constraints UniqueEntityValidator line 138 code result repository constraint repositoryMethod criteria form data and country in attached controller changed value to value received from repository on line 138 This is exact line that changes data in the rest of Symfony application But this only changes null values to values fetched from database string value remain unchanged If I remove Unique validation everythink works ok So line 138 of Symfony Bridge Doctrine Validator Constraints UniqueEntityValidator is the place where the problem is Thank you,,"xabbuh,Simperfit,Simperfit,xabbuh,xabbuh,xabbuh",2017-11-28 00:11:52,2017-12-08 13:57:00
