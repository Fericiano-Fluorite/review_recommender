IS,Command for generating login and register,Q A Bug report no Feature request yes BC Break report no RFC no Symfony version 4 0 1 First off Thank you for developing and managing Symfony This is my first ever contribution after using symfony for more than a year At the beginning of my experience with Symfony and currently after the new version I have been creating lots of small projects to test new stuff and play with the framework I have always found it really annoying that I have to do the same login and register First I create my User entity and then I edit routes yml security yml and so on I suppose that you are familiar with the procedure but if not here is the documentation Login Form and Register form I have always found it annoying that the register documentation uses RegisterController and login documentation uses SecurityController but this is not what I am talking about here Could there be any command to be executed that does this The reason behind this is that it is really repetitive work which is always the same unless some really really specific occasion arrives and it is mostly magic In the documentation its not really explained how it works and you have to figure it out by yourself by looking at the stack trace and debugging Which means that for new programmers like myself there is not really a point of doing it each time and we do it really often because we train and make demo projects all the time Requirements for the project in order to run the command Having symfony project structure Having entity which extends UserInterface Options to the command algorithm The algorithm used Default is bcrypt withsalt Defines that you want your algorithm to use salt if it uses salt register path The route to be used for login Default is register login path The route to be used for login Default is login check path The route to be used for check login Default is login entity The entity to be used for login and register Must implement UserInterface Default looking for User The idea is that the code needed is already in the documentation from the twig to the controller and configuration It just needs to be auto generated rather than copy pasted every time It does not seem as much work to be implemented since the code needed is already in the documentation and I would love to give it a try but I have never contributed to a framework before or any project of such scale If there is anyone good enough to guide me I would love to contribute to Symfony and if it goes well implement other features as well Currently I can not seem to find an entry point for such function to be implemented I know how to write to files and create files and such but I do not know where should I write my function and how to properly check if the project structure is valid If anyone is willing to help me for my first contribution to this project I would be more than happy to continue contributing If not I hope the community likes the idea and implements it so that I can use it,,"iltar,javiereguiluz",2017-12-08 23:03:26,2017-12-10 12:34:37

IS,Outdated documentation because of new Flex tool,Q A Bug report yes Feature request no BC Break report no RFC no Symfony version 3 x since Symfony uses Flex tool I think your documentation is not updated for symfony 3 x and 4 x because new Flex tool I saw it trying to upgrade from a project using Flex from Symfony 4 0 0 to 4 0 1 In section Upgrading a Patch Version e g 3 3 2 to 3 3 3 for symfony version 4 0 it tells that the command to upgrade is composer update symfony symfony but in a Symfony project created with Flex composer create project symfony skeleton my project the default method from version 4 0 there is not any symfony symfony package so for upgrading in that case the command must to be at least i think so composer update or maybe composer update symfony framework bundle So perhaps you must add an subsection Upgrading projects using Flex or something so in documentation for 3 x and 4 x or better add it in documentation for 3 x versions and replace actual documentation for 4 x with this since Flex is the default install method in that version and add an Upgrading a project created without Flex subsection Also the old install method without Flex is still available in Symfony 4 x composer create project symfony framework standard edition my project 4 0 whose result is similar to upgrading from version 3 x to 4 0 and there is nothing about it in your 4 x version documentation And finally if i start a new project version 3 x with for example composer create project symfony framework standard edition my project 3 4 and try to update to version 4 0 1 following the instructions of the subsection 2 Update to the New Major Version via Composer from Upgrading a Major Version e g 3 4 0 to 4 0 0 go to this documentation section update to the new major version via composer Neither composer update symfony symfony nor composer update symfony symfony with dependencies do the work only composer update works rightly In the other cases i get those

update symfony symfony command in that subsection Add an Upgrading projects using Flex subsection in documentation to upgrade for Symfony 4 x versions Perhaps correct section Upgrading a Major Version e g 3 4 0 to 4 0 0 or whatever is wrong with this upgrade process if something I hope have explain it correctly there are some information about Flex that do not appear in the documentation or it is wrong and i think it should be corrected In version 3 x Flex is not the default method so it is an secondary data but in version 4 x it is so it is a main data and the information about the old method is the secondary data But Both of them should appear in the documentation Of course the structure not must to be the one i suggest it is only an idea,,Tobion,2017-12-06 17:32:35,2017-12-26 20:57:44

IS,passing an object from an EntityType to another EntityType Controller ParentType ChildType,Q A Bug report yes Feature request yes BC Break report no RFC no Symfony version 3 3 dev Hi I want to pass an object from an EntityType to another EntityType called in a Controller I found that there is two methods to do this First method Through the constructor This works fine the objects that they did not need any modification before passing them to the EntityType like the EntityManager because this method requires to create a service for the EntityType with the parameter arguments For more detail accessing services and config But since Symfony3 will automatically create the object defined an attribute in the EntityType in the construct method we can not pass an object with a modified attribute is values I mean 1 In the Controller the EntityType classes are called using this syntax form this createForm EntityType class entitytypeObject array So if I want pass an object which is not an instance of EntityType to the EntityType class I can not do that since Symfony3 in Symfony2 7 it is possible because the createForm method need only the EntityType type the EntityType object and an array of options and it did there is no way to pass another specific object 2 In the ParentType the ChildType classes are called using this syntax in the buildForm method using this syntax builder add 'attribute name' CollectionType class array 'entry type' ChildType class arequired' true 'allow add' true 'by reference' false And also here we can not call the ChildType with the constructor so we can not pass any other object for example an object which come from the Controller that we want to pass it to the ChildType through the ParentType Second method Through the options Here I did some researches and I found that we can pass any object instance of any EntityType class using the third parameter options of those methods For the controller form this createForm EntityType class entitytypeObject array 'custom option' custom object This works fine thanks to this solution stackoverflow For the ParentType builder add 'attribute name' CollectionType class array 'entry type' ChildType class arequired' true 'allow add' true 'by reference' false 'custom option' custom object This did not work So if I need to pass an object instance of EntityX from the Controller through the ParentType to the ChildType we have three level of code The first is the Controller class This line of the ChildType 'custom option' null should register the 'custom option' as it did with the use case Controller ParentType but this line has no effect here I think there is a bug or something like this If adding a custom option from the Controller to the ParentType works why it should not work from the ParentType to the ChildType I tried also the solution that I mentioned in the beginning using the services with autowiring and without it but it did not help me because I do not want that the construct method creates only an object of EntityX I need to pass the modified object from the Controller to the ChildType through the ParentType and not creating a new object in the construct For more details of the problem and the suggested solutions that did not help me see here stackoverflow Maybe registering a custom option should not be done using setDefaults method when we create the custom option from an ParentType to ChildType I did not found where is the bug in the code Here is some links for the source code of these steps in the master symfony symfony project maybe you can find it or maybe it can be a new feature that can be added I want to pass an object from the Controller ControllerTrait php using the createForm method L329 this method will call the create method L28 of the form factory service through the ParentType which it will call the add method L32 in the buildForm method L25 of the AbstractType to pass this object to the ChildType class Controller ParentType ChildType The problem is also related to the OptionsResolver class which is the responsible of generating this error Thank you for any solution for this problem,,iltar,2018-01-03 20:16:49,2018-01-04 09:15:37

IS,Validator Incorrect collection validation with different groups,Q A Bug report yes Feature request no BC Break report no RFC no Symfony version 2 7 Hello everyone I have the problem with yaml validation of collection with fields of different groups I debugged a lot and I came to the conclusion that there is a bug in validation of Symfony Component Validator Constraints Collection with different groups Example description For example we had two equal entities User and Category Both have id modifier and info the array of some additional information with keys id title and text Root field id is required I mean it should have the NotBlank constraint Second field modifier is required only on update so we add custom validation group called modify We assume on create we wo not pass this group but we will pass it on update Third field info it is a large collection of different non required parameters in our case they are id some other identification title length should be between 3 and 25 chars only with group info and text length should be between 3 and 25 chars I added additional validation group info for title because I wanted to check it not always only when group is passed Problem reproduce I prepared a little repository for tests to figure out the problem The original successful code is located in validation branch of Aliance SymfonyTest repository The failed code is located into validation collection with different groups branch see pr If you execute phpunit tests you will find out that they fails after adding second group in other field on collection Note that tests fails only with yaml validation What I have already debugged First of all code execution runs to Symfony Component Validator Validator RecursiveContextualValidator validate with my object as a value and all three passed groups 'Default' 'modify' 'info' as a groups img width 587 alt 2017 07 11 19 04 42 src Later it iterates on each groups on every field Reaching the info type it will raise Symfony Component Validator Constraints CollectionValidator validate It will repeat validation on every field without any groups passed img width 789 alt 2017 07 11 19 26 39 src Looks strange seems to me that CollectionValidator should pass fieldConstraint groups to validate method But later somehow valid groups are came to validator Symfony Component Validator Validator RecursiveContextualValidator validateEachObjectIn img width 559 alt 2017 07 11 19 16 03 src But in deeps of this method checked constraint group has already cached as validated because cache key only consist of spl object hash constraint without validation group handling see L866 L872 Can anyone approve this bug or tell me what I am doing wrong,,"sstok,xabbuh",2017-07-11 16:06:07,2018-01-23 09:27:20

IS,RFC WebProfilerBundle Slow kernel terminate can prevent Toolbar from loading,Q A Bug report no Feature request yes BC Break report no RFC yes Symfony version 3 4 I would like to get your opinion concerning the WebDebugToolbar and potentially long running kernel terminate events when sending spooled mails which breaks the toolbar The scenario can be described as follows When using the SwiftMailerBundle with any type of spooling active i e spool type memory the actual sending will be done through Symfony Bundle SwiftmailerBundle EventListener EmailSenderListener before the kernel is actually terminated This will lead to the EmailSenderListener blocking the kernel termination until the response from your email provider is fully processed Until the kernel is fully terminated the profile for the given token cannot be loaded While this is happening the toolbar might already try to load the profile data through its ajax call Based on the performance of the email provider or any potential SwiftMailer plugins it can happen that the WebDebugToolbar will quit after the 5 tries to load the profile and show the error instead Two possible fixes for this problem could be to either increase the number of retries for the ajax call possibly through a configurable value or add a small delay before sending the 404 if the profile could not be loaded and create more time for kernel terminate to finish running Simplified example in Symfony Bundle WebProfilerBundle Controller ProfilerController toolbarAction Is there any need to fix this problem which is mildly annoying although it is not actually a bug in the profiler If someone should fix it or rather give the toolbar more leeway to load the profile data which way would be a preferred one kind regards Joe,,"nicolas-grekas,stof,stof,nicolas-grekas,javiereguiluz",2018-01-19 13:50:40,2018-01-30 16:20:12

IS,RFC DX Re usable Controller layout,Q A Bug report no Feature request no BC Break report no RFC yes Symfony version 3 4 and or 4 0 Hi I'm currently working on some kind of RPC server bundle stack on top of symfony and I have a simple internal method routing which generally repeats the symfony one is I say repeats but not re uses which I hope to do initially since the current routing have several limitations Controller Resolver signature requires the whole Request object but really it uses only controller attribute value can we pass it instead The Request object is used only to build Exception message with getPathInfo call but I think we can overcome it with rethrow on higher level or just refactor it out Most of the exceptions thrown by ControllerResolver do not use the PathInfo to construct the message Controller Name Parser signature hardcodes the Controller Controller Action controler layout and it is even not configurable Replacing this layout to another or making this configurable leads to full class override with copy paste despite of the fact it is open for inheritance we can make action guessing and action parsing to be protected methods which define the layout I also have some thoughts on decoupling Route from HTTP since most of the routing loading process could be fully reused for creating internal routing but the current Route class is all about HTTP routing i e it modifies path to match URI format L159 but I have not fully formalized this thoughts yet I hope we can make the components a bit more decoupled with this ideas WDYT,,"scaytrase,iltar,scaytrase,derrabus,scaytrase,derrabus,scaytrase,derrabus,scaytrase,derrabus,scaytrase,derrabus,scaytrase,derrabus,scaytrase,nicolas-grekas,scaytrase,nicolas-grekas,scaytrase,iltar,Tobion",2017-06-22 08:51:25,2018-02-24 16:47:06

IS,DomCrawler Create an optimized parsing crawler,Q A Bug report no Feature request yes BC Break report no RFC no Symfony version latest Hi The way the Crawler has been implemented seems way to heavy for what we want in most cases Correct me if I am wrong but I think there are 2 ways of using the crawler Simply parsing a document to retrieve information Parsing and editing a document I do not know if we can use it to create a blank document and construct a whole structure not for parsing it after My point being when only parsing a document we use the DomDocument DomElement native functionality The problem is that PHP is creating a heavy tree structure that might be a bit much for what we are trying to accomplish To give a use case I tried to parse an XML which contained 3000 similar elements My content was contained in a string When I gave it to the Crawler it created the whole tree structure which took some time Then I needed to loop on each of those elements to gather the desired information Even if I am not a big XML fan I think it is still quite used in the way I just described For simply parsing data I think not creating these DomDocument DomElement when not provided will spare some time The filtering could be done by regex to avoid the need to create them Of course this can only apply to parsing data only I would love some feedback on this Maybe I am not seeing the whole picture,,stof,2018-02-24 09:33:04,2018-02-27 13:06:22

IS,RFC Security Deprecate AdvancedUserInterface,Q A Bug report no Feature request no BC Break report no RFC yes Symfony version 3 4 0 Currently the AdvancedUserInterface is not used internally other than In the UserChecker L31 Equals check in the AbstractToken hasUserChanged L243 An almost useless reference in a comment of the EquatableInterface L29 L30 The InMemory user uses it L21 User Checker One of the reasons I added the feature for custom user checkers was to avoid using the AdvancedUserInterface as it does not adhere to my business rules needed different checks With this customization the checks it performs are no longer needed to be in the core as developers can easily define this now AbstractToken hasUserChanged Can implement the EquatableInterface and add your own logic I think this is a good practice to do in the first place The method also compares the salt and password L253 L259 which would always fail if you do not store the password in the session during refreshing EquatableInterface comment Also implementation should consider that user instance may implement the extended user interface AdvancedUserInterface So if your User implements the interface you will still have to do the manual checks which makes the check in the abstract token obsolete InMemory user provider Probably most often added via the security config It is easy to use for a bunch of things especially when you have only 1 or 2 users that can manage content However it is 10x easier to comment or remove a user from this list than using one of those flags to prevent a log in If the idea is that a user could still be found but not logged in this feature should be contained to this particular user object and not use the AdvancedUserInterface Method naming isAccountNonExpired isAccountNonLocked isCredentialsNonExpired naming is not ideal I would expect isAccountExpired isAccountLocked areCredentialsExpired However I'm of opinion that renaming does not really solve the issue of trying to introduce certain business logic into the framework RFC I propose to completely deprecate the AdvancedUserInterface in 3 4 and remove it with 4 0 as it no longer serves a purpose This would mean the following actions Currently user checkers are documented but this bit of documentation forbid inactive users advanceduserinterface would have to be updated to explain integration with user checkers Add deprecations when loading the AdvancedUserInterface Optionally add deprecations run time in the abstract token and user checker Listed but I do not think needed Add user user checker checks for the in memory user to keep behavior the same without deprecations for this particular case For 4 0 the following actions would be taken Remove the checks in the abstract token Remove the interface check in the UserChecker and only register it on the in memory user Remove the reference to AdvancedUserInterface in the EquatableInterface Remove the AdvancedUserInterface Remove interface implementation of the in memory user functionality can be kept,,"iltar,iltar,iltar,stof,iltar,iltar,curry684,apfelbox,iltar",2017-06-25 10:21:53,2018-03-01 07:26:09

IS,Customize AppKernel for cache log location,Q A Bug report no Feature request yes BC Break report no RFC yes Symfony version 4 0 This is something that I asked for feedback in the Symfony slack for and got some support and confirmation that many people come up with similar solutions Background The issue is that for different environments particularly Virtual Machines it is desirable to have different paths for the var directory Furthermore it is desirable to have a different location for the Composer vendor directory The specific situation where this is necessary is in virtual machines where the project lies in a synced network mounted folder Often the extensive reading writing that Symfony does with these three directories on every request results in a big performance hit when they are inside the synced folder Moving the directories to a local location in the VM resolves this but people might not want the same override on their deployment servers Solution I have a fairly clean solution for making this more flexible There is a default path for these directories but I have a check for a SYMFONY VAR DIR environment variable If it exists that path as a prefix to cache and var instead This is done in the AppKernel Composer supports a COMPOSER VENDOR DIR environment variable which it will automatically use as the install path for vendor files Again I added a check in index php for this environment variable and it will be used to include autoload php if it exists otherwise a default path will be used I think that it would be nice if this kind of behavior was natively supported by Symfony and adding it would not require much extra logic I think it would be best configured as one of Symfony is environment parameters so that it could be configured per machine In addition to SYMFONY VAR DIR the optional variables SYMFONY CACHE DIR and SYMFONY LOG DIR could be supported if specific control over those paths are desired For Composer I'm not sure if it could cause any unpredictable behavior for some people to just add the same environment variable check that I described above Hypothetically if the COMPOSER VENDOR DIR variable exists there should be no reason to expect the vendor directory elsewhere I would like to make that check native to Symfony I'm requesting comment on this issue because I'm not sure if these changes would be accepted I could imagine them being denied on the basis that the Symfony skeleton is desired to be as barebones as possible and these modifications can be added by anyone that needs them Although there seems to be Also these changes would be useful for all currently supported releases of Symfony I'm not sure if these changes are too significant to safely add into the older LTS releases If there are recommendations on how to better deal with adding this functionality into the project please share them There seem to be quite a few people that are interested in this feature people that always copy paste their code to overwrite these methods when they make a new project,,"javiereguiluz,javiereguiluz,fabpot",2018-03-03 12:15:56,2018-03-04 16:34:35

IS,Yaml PARSE DATETIME getTimestampRegex does not support string timezones,Q A Bug report yes Feature request no BC Break report yes no RFC yes no Symfony version At least 3 3 onwards The Yaml component will attempt to parse strings as DateTime objects if they match the regex in the private static function getTimestampRegex It passes new DateTimeZone 'UTC' as the second parameter to DateTime Causing php to use UTC instead of the default timezone unless there is a timezone set specifically in the parsed string PHP allows passing time zones as strings to DateTime overriding the second timezone parameter The regex in getTimestampRegex does not however recognize these strings as a timestamp and so they are never parsed So a value such as 2018 3 21 00 00 00 00 Europe London never gets parsed as a DateTime as it does not match the regex It is almost impossible to make the Yaml parser parse strings as date times with a string timezone other than UTC As the method containing the regex is private and cannot be overridden the method containing the call to that method is also private and cannot be overridden What this means is that the yaml DateTime parser is useless for parsing config files in time zones that use daylight savings To be clear numeric time zones such as something like 2018 3 21 00 00 00 00 0100 do in fact work but this is no good for daylight savings when loading from a config file unless the values in the config file are to be adjusted each time daylight savings changes,,"stof,stof,stof,stof,stof,xabbuh",2018-03-20 11:52:32,2018-03-21 08:43:54
