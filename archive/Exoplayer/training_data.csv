PR,Upgrade ExoPlayer with controllable speed,Goal of this pull request Update to Google is most recent ExoPlayer version Port previous speed change modifications to new version There have been some modifications compared to Hooloop is earlier modifcation Now support for x86 as well e g Genymotion simulator This one is using a different approach than previously Here we preserve the partial buffer writing to audio track so we do not lose performance Instead the speed is changed directly before initializing the temporary buffer Additionally the channel configuration for libsonic has also been fixed This approach works with all audio file types including vorbis Other notes I am not sure if it is still necessary to set AudioTrack type to AudioManager STREAM VOICE CALL instead of AudioManager STREAM MUSIC This has been directly ported from Hooloop and did not hurt so I just left it like that 90f86c6 The same goes for changing the DEFAULT MIN BUFFER MULTIPLICATION FACTOR This has also been directly ported from Hooloop and did not hurt so I just left it like that dd28f61 Also I disabled the previous codec fix for Xiaomi as it forced the AAC codec We need to see if this problem still applies and fix it properly if necessary 77fd609 In case there are any problems with the new MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer implementation I added the previous one as an alternative renderer as MediaCodecHooloopAudioTrackRenderer adc6aa5 The newest ExoPlayer implements a feature called non blocking write to AudioTrack This will only work with Android 5 0 I have disabled that for our renderer as it requires a different approach for libsonic It wo not be a big change but it is not required now Just keep it in mind I have added todo notes in code for that,,,2015-01-22 02:15:39,2015-01-22 02:50:28

IS,DASH Live Edge Calculation Erroneous,In the current ExoPlayer version dev branch the live edge for dynamic DASH content is usually calculated as the media end time of that segment which is the last one described by the DASH manifest This last described segment is determined as follows 1 In case of a SegmentList the last segment in the list is used 2 In case of a SegmentTemplate 2 1 If a SegmentTimeline is present the last one described by the timeline is used 2 2 If the duration field is present 2 2 1 The last segment in the current Period is used determined using Period duration or indirectly as a default value MPD mediaPresentationDuration 2 2 2 The index is unbound if no info about the last segment is present In this case the MPD availabilityStartTime is used for determining the live edge For most cases this will always work fine However for case 2 2 1 using Period duration this is no correct behavior The Period duration and MPD mediaPresentationDuration describe the total duration including the future of a period or a stream Meaning at MPD availabilityStartTime MPD mediaPresentationDuration the stream will end A usecase would e g be live content where you do not want to update the MPD So in this case the ExoPlayer would set the live edge as the end time of the stream which might be in the past present or future The correct approach would be to use the MPD availabilityStartTime as in case 2 2 2 Most simple fix i can think of is modifying the function getLiveSeekPosition in com google android exoplayer dash DashChunkSource java to always using the indexUnbounded true part Note that this would apply the method also to cases 1 and 2 1 More information can be found in the Guidelines for Implementation Live Services based on DASH IF IOPs on DASH IF,,"ojw28,ojw28,ojw28",2015-01-23 13:01:43,2015-01-26 14:50:34

PR,Better management of blacklisted playlists,Added an expiration time field to playlists blacklisted to allow Exoplayer to continue playback when playlists that failed were recovered from a bad state In live environments some times occur that primary encoder stop working for a while In that cases HLS failover mechanism in the player should detect the situation and switch to playlists served by the backup encoder in case a backup encoder exists This was well managed before these changes However and to ensure a playback experience that can recover itself from temporary issues we cannot blacklist a playlist forever When streaming live events using HLS it is quite typical that the player needs to switch from primary to backup playlists and from backup to primary ones from time to time to have playback working when temporary issues in the network encoder are happening Most of the issues are recoverable so what I have implemented is a mechanism that makes blacklisted playlists to be available again after a while 60 seconds Evaluation of this algorithm should happen just when something fails If player is working with a backup playlist it shouldn t switch to the primary one at least something fail,,"jeoliva,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,jeoliva,ojw28,jeoliva",2015-02-23 14:17:00,2015-02-25 14:33:26

IS,Unexpected delay in fetching manifests,Branch dev Device Google Nexus Player I'm looking into a delay when playing some videos and it appears that it is caused by an extermely slow request to fetch the manifest My initial thought was that the server was taking far too long to respond However after looking through the server logs and using Curl to manually hit the server it is taking roughly 200 300ms to respond which does not explain why the manifest fetcher is taking over 8 seconds After adding in lots of logging i have found the following code to be the cause of the 8 second delay in DefaultHttpDataSource This seems to suggest that the network request is taking a long time to succeed I had not noticed this issue on any other requests to the same server so I decided to add my own AsyncTask which is executed on a separate scheduler to hit the server with the same URL My own AsyncTask is completing the network request in 200 300ms but the one used by the DefaultHttpDataSource continues to block Any thoughts on what might be the cause of this I initially considered that it might be some type of connection caching issue but subsequently added in a random UUID into the URL to make sure it changed between requests This unfortunately did not resolve the issue,,"IanDBird,ojw28,IanDBird,IanDBird",2015-04-07 13:19:43,2015-04-09 14:40:32

IS,ExoPlayer STATE ENDED called multiple times,It was easy on MediaPlayer with onCompletionListener to detect when a song finished playing but on ExoPlayer I have an issue with the states I used addListener method to detect when the ExoPlayer is states are changing and I have an if condition whenever the ExoPlayer is in STATE ENDED which is something like this code public void onPlayerStateChanged boolean playWhenReady int playbackState if exoPlayer getPlaybackState ExoPlayer STATE ENDED Log d myFilter Song finished code The problem is that when a song finishes and I played some songs before the STATE ENDED is detected or the code in the if condition below which is responsible for detecting when the ExoPlayer is in STATE ENDED is called multiple times for those previous songs played too as it would finish them too Example If I play one song and then the song finish the STATE ENDED is detected only once which is great but if I play let is say 3 songs then when the 3th songs finishes the STATE ENDED is detected 3 times and the code in the if condition below is executed 3 times Even if I left the first song to finish playing always when the second song will be finished the STATE ENDED will be detected 2 times not once this is available to any other number of songs played STATE ENDED will be detected according to how many songs I played even they finished before FOR THE SAKE OF EXPLANATION Shortly If I play let is say 5 songs then the ExoPlayer STATE ENDED is called detected 5 times Even shortly The ExoPlayer STATE ENDED is detected multiple times Here is my code on my method to play music code public void playMusic final int position ArrayList String songsPaths final ArrayList String songsNames try code How can I make the ExoPlayer STATE ENDED to be detected only once for a song I even tried with a custom thread to detect whenever the ExoPlayer finishes and the logic was something like this I check in a while loop if the exoPlayer getCurrentPosition returns a value equals to the total song length the last value when the exoplayer finishes playing should be equal to the total song length but it always is lesser than it so not even this did not work so I went back to checking the states I need to check when the song finished to play the next song,,ojw28,2015-06-20 14:05:21,2015-06-20 14:40:47

IS,excessive delay from STATE PREPARING to STATE BUFFERING,I'm seeing that it takes an anormal amount of time to go from STATE PREPARING to STATE BUFFERING is some circustances from the logs it seems that when in an HLS stream the audio packets arrive before the video ones the PCR is in the video PID and the audio packets have a PTS counter that is less than the video ones our audio track has a delay relative to video of up to 700 ms a negative sampleTimeUs is assigned to the h264 samples and until the current sampleTimeUs does not reach the audio current timeUs the player doesn t transition to STATE BUFFERING this can be a long time if ever and the player must be able to enter in STATE BUFFERING at most in a time equal to the audio video track delay as all the audio samples are queued in the buffer so when the current video PTS reach the first audio PTS in the buffer we are ready to start buffering the logs of a normal execution 04 22 16 45 01 722 25179 25179 com google android

IS,AudioStuttering,I have my own implementation of TrackRenderer for a mp3 decoder that I integrated When a lollipop device goes to standby and comes back its not always repeatable but the audio starts to stutter until I force stop the application In the beginning I thought it was the decoder I implemented so I tried comparing the file output between a stuttering track to a normal one The files are identical I then thought maybe its taking too long to decode so I increased the buffer size and called setPlayReady false in order for the data to buffer It stutters the same as if I did not pause I am currently thinking the issue is with either my implementation of audio track or an OS bug The bug only happens on Lollipop devices Not sure if this is the right place to post this but hoping I can get help Thanks,,ojw28,2015-07-29 09:43:56,2015-07-29 13:56:45

IS,H 264 Support non square Pixel Aspect Ratio in MPEG DASH Smooth Streaming,I saw that there was a issue reported here about supporting non square Pixel aspect ratio for HLS streams We have a MPEG DASH non square stream unfortunately cannot be shared due to legal reasons and it renders incorrectly because the change is obviously applicable to HLS streams only Is there a possibility to create a generic H 264 helper class that can parse SPS PPS data to return the pixelWidthAspectRatio and other necessary information which can then be used across several formats,,"ojw28,ojw28",2015-08-08 00:00:13,2015-08-11 17:25:17

IS,Latency lag while network streaming H264 via UDP,I am trying to live network stream H264 video from my server to a device via UDP using TSExtractor and UdpDataSource I am currently using VLC to stream the source which is wrapped in a TS container It essentially works in the sense that I can see the video play on the device The problem is that over time the video on the device becomes very latent relative to what the sever is currently streaming out The video being displayed on the device can be many seconds up to a minute before something totally breaks behind what is being streamed from the VLC server I expect the video on the device to play from the live edge but this is clearly not happening and I am unsure of the source of them problem When the live stream starts the device will lag behind the server by maybe 500ms which is totally acceptable This acceptable playback of the stream can go on for long periods of time The latency issue appears to begin when packets are dropped this is UDP AudioTrack will report a discontinuity is detected TsExtractor will report an unexpected start code EventLogger will eventually report dropped frames Some period of time later the video playback on the device will resume but always some period of time seems to be related to the time when packets were originally lost behind what the server is currently streaming After a few periods of dropped packets the device can be lagging behind the server by many seconds When the video being displayed on the device is significantly behind what is being streamed by the server I can pause the server and the device will continue to play the video up to the point where the server was paused Clearly a lot of bytes are being buffered somewhere on the device when the device starts to lag behind the server So two questions 1 Where would many seconds of possibly uncompressed video be buffered I have crawled through most of ExoPlayer and I am not seeing anything obvious I suspect compressed video is being buffered somewhere in the codec itself but I thought I would eliminate ExoPlayer first 2 If the buffering is occurring in ExoPlayer or even in the codec is there anything I can do to mitigate resolve the issue so the player always tries to play from the front of the buffer the live edge I am trying to keep the video as live as possible so if packets get dropped I could not care less up to a point I just want to play the video I receive as soon as possible,,"tresvecesseis,tresvecesseis,tresvecesseis,tresvecesseis,tresvecesseis,tresvecesseis",2015-08-04 16:28:47,2015-08-12 18:48:50

IS,Access to low level components,Hi I am the developer of an HLS based streaming app ATM I'm simply using a VideoView I was tasked to add support for an unsupported media format Specifically the HLS chunks contains an H 264 compatible encoded video in witch additional data is added in Supplemental Enhanceement Information SEI of the H 264 Network Abstraction Layer NAL Now I was said I need to drop the high level approach of the VideoView and switch to the low level MediaCodec API AFAIK after a day of trying the MediaExtractor MediaCodec etc classes can not directly read an m3u8 file follow the playlist find the correct level and download the chunks ts and frankly I'm not sure it is the fastest approach to obtain the result I was suggested to use ExoPlayer as an intermediate level approach I am successfully able to use the player to stream a normal HLS video But I'm having troubles trying to get access to the underling low level APIs Searching throug the code I found some interesting classes for example com google android exoplayer extractor ts TsExtractor PesReader but I am missing how the low level pieces are created and interconnected by the ExoPlayer to make stupid questions what compent instantiate that class How can I use from the outside Is there some specific pointer to access this point Another thing I also need to access the decoded H 264 video frame in a form equivalent to just to explain this custom decoder needs the additional data and the base frame that should be drawn and compose them creating a new frame that I should really send to the SurfaceView I am now using,,"ojw28,ojw28",2015-08-18 14:36:56,2015-08-18 21:23:34

IS,Timeshift HLS,Hi I would like to know if you have any plans on timeshifting seeking functionallity on live HLS I get a three hour window from my server so it is possible to jump backwards but when I seek in the exoplayer it does not work Any ideas suggestions or ETA on when this might be implemented If I get pointed in a helpful direction I might be able to contribute with a solution myself Bob,,ojw28,2015-08-31 10:02:13,2015-08-31 14:55:44
IS,Changing stream takes a lot of time,I use ExoPlayer to create some kind of the TV My problem is if user looks channel for some time for example 5 min and try to change it to another one it will take a lot of time to change stream once it took 15 min to change stream But if user looks first channel 1 min when he will change channel it will take seconds to change stream For my app I use DemoPlayer from sample project When user changes channel app calls releasePlayer and after that preparePlayer with new stream is url Also I tried another way to change stream I have fragment which contains ExoPlayer and I tried recreate fragment when I need to change channel and set up it instead of old one And it is work perfect In this case It takes seconds to change stream But problem is when I tried ti change stream only via player methods it takes a lot of time Method releasePlayer and preparePlayer the same as at this class,,ojw28,2015-08-31 16:21:34,2015-09-01 09:54:58

IS,SubripParser asked to parse multiple times,This might be working as designed but I thought best to raise after observing the behaviour I have basically been having a look at SRT support and have a very basic implementation working using the sample code provided in I added in my own logging into SubripParser parse to see how often it is being called I found the following On player start it is being called twice After any seek it is also being called Of course the output of the parse method is the same since nothing has changed to potentially invalidate it It does not really cause an issue though unless the subtitle parsing is super expensive so feel free to close if not worth trying to optimise,,"IanDBird,ojw28",2015-08-25 15:23:09,2015-09-01 11:26:48

IS,Ability to switch audio track during playback,I'm attempting to add support to our video player that allows individual audio tracks to be selected during playback Initially i'm focussing on my ExtractorRendererBuilder with MP4s but this really affects any media which can contain multiple different audio tracks First Issue MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer by default will select and use the first audio track provided by the SampleSource It therefore seemed appropriate to extend this class and override the handlesMimeType used during onPrepare in order to try and select the audio stream that you want A problem then arrises that mimeType is not a unique identifier within a video For example you could easily have an MP4 which has 2 AAC tracks the main feature vs the directors commentary In order to make it easier to identify individual tracks it might be worth considering including the trackIndex into the method for example With this change in place it should then be possible to create N individual audio track renderers one for each known audio track and to disable enable them on demand Second Issue There are two possible related issues with what I described above Are there any overheads associated with having lots of separate instances of MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer What if you do not know up front how many audio tracks are available The audio tracks are available via the SampleSource but this is prepared after the MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer is have been created I therefore looked at what it would take to have a single MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer that when we needed to change it because we needed to select a new track index we would attempt to re use the original SampleSource but create a new instance of the audio track renderer However there does not appear to be any way to replace substitute a new track renderer like this As mentioned in my approach above the handlesMimeType is called when being prepared However if you call the ExoPlayer prepare a second time it will dispose of all the original renderers and eventually their SampleSource that we are trying to re use Is there something that i'm missing on how best to implement this,,"IanDBird,Ood-Tsen,ojw28,IanDBird,IanDBird,IanDBird,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,IanDBird,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28",2015-06-02 16:16:18,2015-09-01 13:37:14

IS,Exoplayer can get stuck in preparing state when preparing HLS content with small ts chunk size,I have found a race condition bug inside HlsSampleSource in Exoplayer 1 3 3 It is specially more reproducible if the TS chunk is of small duration 2 second I do not know if this issue also affects Exoplayer 1 4 2 or dev branch At this time I am also unable to share a sample HLS content which shows the problem I decided to raise an issue so that others who may have encountered this issue could try the workaround I have found as well as to raise awareness of this issue potentially lurking in the 1 4 2 dev branch and other renderer builders I would also love to hear your thoughts in case there is a problem with the workaround Symptom of the problem On calling prepare on Hls the exoplayer remains stuck in preparing state even though the TS chunk has been fully downloaded However the player can sometimes finish preparing if the chunk load complete comes after a call to HlsSampleSource to prepare Cause of the issue I traced the problem traced down to the HlsSampleSource and was happening due to a race condition between call to prepare and onLoadCompleted Basically the prepare is called in a polling loop every 10msec The chunk download proceeds independently and the data is read by the TSExtractor Once the TS extractor has enough data it does some processing in it is consume function and sets up a flag If this flag is then read by HlsSampleSource HlsExtractorWrapper on the prepare call and everything is great However if the chunkOnLoadComplete for a TS chunk in HlsSampleSource happens to precede the prepare call because it does not see any tracks it proceeds to clear the extractor state which also clears the previous flag see L356 Therefore on the next call of prepare the HlsExtractorWrapper fails to find anything and fails to prepare and simply keeps trying without ever succeeding It seems to me that the code assumed that the chunk load complete for a TS chunk wo not happen before the extractor sample source has been prepared My solution to this issue I put a simple if check here L359 in the else just before clearState etc Basically the function returns immediately if the HlsSampleSource is not prepared and the currentLoadable is ts chunk else if prepared isCurrentLoadableTsChunk return This prevents the clearing of state and allows the next call to prepare find what it is looking for and transition to next state I am still testing it but i have not seen any problems with it thus far,,"ojw28,ojw28,ojw28",2015-09-04 06:27:43,2015-09-04 11:56:03

IS,Avoid the final modifier all together,As you saw in my previous PR that was accepted thanks I had issues with final methods that I needed to override While bumping ExoPlayer in our project I'm now experiencing more issues with added final modifiers For instance a test broke since we could not mock a certain class which had final methods Therefore again unless there is a very good reason I suggest removing any final modifiers to make it easier for consumers of the SDK to test their applications I was able to solve my specific issue by a rather ugly workaround so this is more of a general suggestion,,"pakerfeldt,ojw28",2015-09-04 08:35:11,2015-09-09 10:26:16

IS,When a live stream ends state does not always transition to STATE ENDED,Each media chunk carries a flag indicating whether it is the final chunk in the stream However for live DASH SS HLS streams it is possible for the chunk source implementation to return the final chunk in the stream before the manifest is marked as no longer being live In such cases the flag does not get set correctly on the final chunk The player then continues to attempt to fetch subsequent chunks indefinitely and gets stuck in the buffering state The fix is to pass an end of stream indicator outside of the chunk rather than embedded within it,,ojw28,2015-09-07 09:24:18,2015-09-10 18:08:37

IS,Preserve and expose original track index,I have been testing the latest stream selection changes available on the dev thanks for the feature One problem that I'm having though is that ExoPlayer will parse the video file and build tracks for only supported mime types The original index of the track within the container is lost The problem we have in our application is that we allow the user to select from any available track from the source media If the track is not supported by ExoPlayer natively we kick off a transcode and convert that track to something else via HLS This means that the track selection we present to the user is from the original video When the user performs a selection we have to translate the selected index from the original video to the player is representation In order to do this we have to have a map of what audio stream types are supported for the different extractors This is very fragile as if when we update ExoPlayer it would break this translation whenever a new audio format is supported Would it be possible at all to expose the original track index This means that translation is super simple between source media to player representation and is not affected by the player is capabilities changing,,"IanDBird,ojw28,IanDBird",2015-09-08 10:34:42,2015-09-28 19:39:47

PR,FLV H 264 AAC support,FLV is not one of the most used containers right now and of course not a priority for any player but I though it could be useful adding it to Exoplayer for 2 reasons 1 FLV was pretty used not too much time ago and still there are a lot of legacy video content libraries that are using this container I have even seen a couple of reported issues asking for FLV support so there are some interest on it 2 And second and most important a share knowledge reason In other words I think this is really useful to allow other developers to better understand how to build their own extractors for Exoplayer FLV is one of the simplest and best documented video audio container formats so it is easy going through the code looking at the parser flv extractor FLV specification and see what is the architecture behind Exoplayer extractors MP4 type of containers are much more complex and are a so hard way of starting coding or trying to understand extractors Regarding the implementation as title stated this pull request is adding support for FLV container and more specifically when content within FLV is encoded using H 264 and AAC,,"jeoliva,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,jeoliva,ojw28,jeoliva,jeoliva,jeoliva,jeoliva,jeoliva,jeoliva,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,jeoliva,jeoliva,ojw28,ojw28,jeoliva,jeoliva,ojw28,jeoliva,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,jeoliva,jeoliva,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28",2015-09-29 15:22:22,2015-10-26 10:17:53

IS,Bug in streaming HLS H265 video massive frame drop,I have previously been using ExoPlayer 1 4 2 to stream a HLS H265 video and had no issue Then when upgrading to 1 5 1 the video plays but has massive frame drop only about half the frames play and the video is very jerky I compared the source between the two versions and went through the changes in extractor ts TsExtractor java and extractor ts H265Reader java Bug 1 I noticed that the addition of the DTS decode timestamp adjustment in TsExtractor java was causing the value of PtsTimestampAdjustor timestampOffsetUs to go from 1466733 in 1 4 2 to 1400000 in 1 5 1 This has the effect of shifting all the timestamps earlier and skipping 2 of them So instead of getting 0 166833 100100 33367 66733 133467 as in 1 4 2 I get 0 233566 166833 100100 133466 200200 after fixing for bug 2 below So I can just comment out the line ptsTimestampAdjuster adjustTimestamp dts and make things work like in 1 4 2 but I do not think that is your intention Bug 2 The changes in H265Reader java are causing the samples to be extracted and decoded in a different order than before In 1 4 2 even through the H265 samples are not extracted in presentation time order the frames would always be decoded and sent to MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer processOutputBuffer in presentation time order Now in 1 5 1 the frames are not sent in presentation time order causing the massive frame drop I narrowed down the problem to the fact that the timestamps being used in H265Reader are one sample ahead of what was used in 1 4 2 after removing the code for the DTS adjustment So instead of getting 0 166833 100100 33367 66733 133467 as in 1 4 2 I get 166833 100100 33367 66733 133467 333667 Notice that timestamp 0 is missing completely As a temp fix in SampleReader endNalUnit I added sampleTimeUsPrev sampleTimeUs before sampleTimeUs is set and then use sampleTimeUsPrev as the timestamp passed to sampleMetadata This fix causes the timestamps to be the same as in 1 4 2 and the sample sizes are the same as well As a side note my temp fix for bug 2 fixes the issue 99 9 of the time but there is another issue when it is SampleReader startNalUnit that is calling outputSample In this case the timestamp is correct but the size of the sample is wrong compared to 1 4 2 Also this call is made at the beginning of every TS segment except the first one I have not yet noticed the effect of the sample size difference since it only occurs for one sample every 8 seconds My device is a Samsung Note 4 running Lollipop 5 01 I am happy to give you any more details necessary in order to fix this bug Thanks,,"ojw28,ojw28",2015-10-23 21:38:48,2015-10-26 15:36:49

PR,Provide mechanism to include alternative mime types for MediaCodec lookup,Context 909 This provides a simple mechanism to include alternative mime types to be considered when attempting to identify a devices associated MediaCodec,,"IanDBird,IanDBird,IanDBird,ojw28,ojw28,IanDBird,IanDBird,ojw28,IanDBird,ojw28,IanDBird,IanDBird",2015-11-09 14:39:44,2015-11-11 13:47:48
IS,Consider allowing alternative MimeTypes to handle device differences,One thing i have seen is that some devices use slightly different MimeTypes for a number of audio codecs mainly DTS DTS HD TrueHD I think this might be because as far as i'm aware this is not strictly specified anywhere and is more of an adopted standard Of course one stance would be to just not support these devices which are wrong I did however have a go to see what it would take to allow alternative MimeType lookups to allow their MediaCodec is to be used I found the following changes were required Modify MediaCodecUtil getMediaCodecInfo method to consider the specified mimeType but also any other alternatives known for that type Modify the MediaFormat getFrameworkMediaFormatV16 method to translate the mimeType into one specific for the device The way I did this was to simply add another method into the MediaCodecUtil to perform the lookup I actually have a patch that I could submit as a Pull Request for this but thought it was unclear as to whether you consider this an ExoPlayer issue to be resolved or whether these devices should simply not be supported The device I was testing around with was the Minix Neo but I believe that the Sony Android TVs also use a different MimeType for DTS than that defined in ExoPlayer which maybe they have fixed already in a recent FW update Thoughts,,"IanDBird,ojw28,IanDBird,IanDBird,ojw28,ojw28",2015-10-30 13:30:57,2015-11-11 13:48:10

IS,Problem adapting between SD and HD Widevine content,I have some DASH content that is Widevine protected It is throwing an exception android media MediaCodec CryptoException with a full stack trace below on adaption to a track that is protected with an HD key from a track that is protected with an SD key Adaption between bitrates of the same resolution work fine The same MPD behaves fine when using Shaka on Chrome browsers both desktop and Android which leads me to believe that this is an ExoPlayer issue or how I'm using ExoPlayer From what I can tell on adaption from SD HD Shaka is making a new license request for the HD track as soon as the first chunk of the HD track is done downloading Then it is good to go and does not need to make a new license request when going from HD SD as it had the SD license from initial playback Unless I'm missing it it does not look like the provided ExoPlayer implementations handle this behavior I tested a sample MPD from the ExoPlayer demo app titled WV HDCP not specified in my own implementation and it worked fine It adapted back and forth from SD resolutions to HD resolutions But it only made two license requests one for the audio and one for the initial video which I confirmed by removing the audioRenderer and it only made the one license request for video Is this likely to have worked because the tracks contained in the sample MPD were only protected with an SD or an HD key Just some notes about my environment all the content is on demand not live we are not using key rotation and we have tested on Nexus Player Android 6 0 Nexus 5X Android 6 0 Galaxy Tab A Android 5 0 2 all of which I believe are Widevine level 1 Stack trace for exception,,"ojw28,ojw28",2015-11-18 22:36:50,2015-11-24 20:31:28

IS,How to handle unknown duration when dealing with multiple sources,Sorry for the vague title but I came across a scenario that I was not entirely sure how best to resolve Our application can request a HLS video stream containing the video and audio tracks but a separate MKV file that contains the subtitle SRT track This is to allow playback of SRTs without being converted and also to support progressive downloading of the file This all works except The MKV file just has the embedded SRT and therefore no duration associated with with when parsed via the WebmExtractor This means that the text MediaFormat it is created with ends up having a duration of TrackRenderer UNKNOWN TIME US This means that when ExoPlayerImplInternal incrementalPrepareInternal is called although the other track formats have a valid and known duration due to the missing one from the track format the duration is recorded as unknown I have the following simple fix hack but wanted to know if there was any recommended change that would be better,,"IanDBird,ojw28,IanDBird,ojw28,IanDBird",2016-01-04 14:59:44,2016-01-04 19:52:53

IS,QUESTIONS getting the real media time mpeg2 in TS TS seeking resume,I will start with the TS Seeking Resume I have already found an issue here where someone asked about seeking in TS files and your reply was that you would only support seeking in file types that actually send the seek information in the file and apparently TS files do not I'm ok with that I do wonder how I would go about supporting a RESUME from last playback position when all I have is the last playback time Also when a seek happens I'm seeing ExoPlayer call an open on the datasource with a position of 0 and this causes the application to basically reset the stream ie I have watched 5 minutes of video I hit skip forward and the result is that I'm back to the beginning of the file If Exo is not going to support seeking in TS file should not it just drop the seek request instead of re issuing an open on the datasource from the beginning Is there a way that I can configure Exo to not work this way Should Could the DataSource is DataSpec contain a postion and a positionTS or US field whereby the postionTS field is the time requested In this way a data source implantation could choose to implement their own mechanism to seek in a non seekable file The second question is about whether or not ExoPlayer support MPEG2 in it is TS parser Or does the parser not care and if a device has MPEG2 hardware decoding it will just work The first question about getting the REAL media time from the stream instead of what the player has been tracking ie calling getCurrentPosition appears to return a tracking position that is maintained by the player is clock and not what the stream is actually telling you To understand why this important to SageTV let me run through how a SageTV player typically handles TS streams As you said TS files are not seekable but in the real world lots of hardware produces TS files For example the HDPVR device produced ts files SageTV handles this by introducing a streaming model that it calls PUSH The basic premis of this streaming model is that a tread on the client accepts data and stores it in a buffer and the Player thread reads from the buffer Where a user seeks this is what happens 1 The SageTV server handles the request to Seek 2 SageTV server sends a FLUSH command to the client 3 Client receives the FLUSH command and now has to tell the Player clear all of it is player data and start to receive new data 4 SageTV server find the stream position and immediately starts pushing the new data 5 Client Player starts playing new data 6 Server begins requesting current play back time from the Client so it can track and verify that the player is playing the data at the correct location So as you see under this streaming model the player does not need to know or care if the stream is seekable since the seeking is handled on the server and seeks happen extremely quickly I have run into a couple of problems here specifically with items 3 and 6 FLUSH is not something that a player typically handles as a command but it is something that a player has to be aware of since when it seeks internally it has to flush all the prepared frames and start processing new ones So as a work around typically when a FLUSH happen I will send a seek 1 or seek Long MAX VALUE both of these cause the player to clear it is buffered frames The problem is that in doing so because TS files are not seekable the player call open on the DataSource again which for PUSH datasource is basically ignored and I just keep flush our caches data and start sending the new PUSHed data But the player now internally thinks that is playing from position 0 And when step 6 happens I call getCurrentPostion to get the media time I get back values NOT from the TS stream but rather from the internal clock of the player and this get sent back to the sagetv server and it now thinks we are playing from the beginning of the file And this leaves the client and server in an inconsistent state since the player is actually playing video 30 seconds ahead because we seeked forward but it is getCurrentPosition tells sagetv that we starting over So after all that if there is a way to tell the player to clear it is frames to start over without calling Seek 1 that would be great but I would still have an issue in that the Player while receiving new data would not report the time from the TS stream but instead report it is own internal clock Is there a way to configure Exo to use the time from the stream,,"ojw28,ojw28,ojw28",2015-12-19 13:35:07,2016-01-04 21:01:51

IS,Seeking to a previous position in buffer,Hi For my use of ExoPlayer it is necessary to seek to a position within 500ms of the actual playback position without rebuffering Since you said in previous question that you do not plan on keeping previous buffer I tried to implement this functionality by adapting the RollingSampleBuffer I'm using ExtractorRendererBuilder and only play audio via http stream Instead of clearing the data in the dropDownstreamTo function I increment an iterator which is later used in the readData function to get the right allocation from the dataQueue I use The else statement would contain the original code for timeUs timesUs relativeReadIndex This works so far I can seek to previous positions One problem is that after some time the totalBytesDropped is bigger than the absolutePosition the positionInAllocation is negative This is probably due to the fact that i never adjust the totalBytesDropped when going a bit backwards Now I do not know how to get the number of bytes I have to subtract after the seek backwards Is there a possibility to do so And another problem that occurred is that the player is stuck in buffering state after about 50 60 minutes of playback Now I'm not sure if this has something to do with not clearing the dataQueue or some other buffer limitations Thanks in advance,,ojw28,2016-01-16 13:24:32,2016-01-16 15:35:44

IS,Adding image filters to exoplayer video,I am interested in adding Instagram like image filters into my exoplayer video implementation I can think of two ways to approach this challenge either to 1 Override MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer processOutputBuffer L384 and similarly to what this gist does for modifying audio modify the video ByteBuffer buffer to contain the processed filtered frames and return it to super If this is the best method I am wondering what the ByteBuffer actually contains i e how far through the processing is it If I were to pass it to a library like Android GPUImage which utilises OpenGL to process images does anyone have an experience how I could get the ByteBuffer into the OpenGL functions 2 Allow Exoplayer to write the video frames to a Surface extract the frames from the Surface and pass them to an image processing library before writing back onto a Surface Even better would of course be to intercept the frames just before writing to the Surface and pass those instead One example of an image processing library that produces the required effects is Android GPUImage It requires a GLSurfaceView to write to L69 GLSurfaceView extends from SurfaceView so there is no problem getting a Surface for exoplayer to write to I tried in demo PlayerActivity onCreate L135 to change the SurfaceView to a GLSurfaceView and include I guess this comes from GPUImage trying to write to the Surface using GLSurfaceView Renderer whilst at the same time Exoplayer is trying to write to the Surface itself Does anyone have any suggestions how I could get the two renderers to play nicely together Generally which of the two methods do you think is more likely to work I understand you may have never heard of GPUImage so I am trying to keep my questions relevant to an Exoplayer implementation Equally GPUImage is not the only library in the world so I am open to suggestions,,ojw28,2016-02-02 15:01:22,2016-02-03 22:37:56

IS,Change playback rate of video track,I would like to reduce the playback rate of a video to 50 or increase it to 200 26 is a similar thread but contrary to what they are trying to do I do not really care about the audio One of the first comments is To clarify do you mean with audio sped up but corrected to still be at the correct pitch or without My answer is without audio Does this make a significant different to the complexity of the answer I am primarily interested in locally stored mp4 files I am looking to support Android 16 and above It sounds like the playback speed of the video is tied to the speed of the audio Is that always true I have tried using this gist to slow the audio but as says in his comment on 26 he has not factored in video I find that with video and slow motion the playback becomes very jerky far more than should be expected from having fewer frames rendered to the screen per second This sample does suggest it accounts for video albeit based on an older version of exoplayer but the main contribution of mCurrentSpeed to the code is to modify the joiningDeadlineUs Is this what I am missing to get smooth playback in slow motion Naively it sounded like an optimisation rather that being key,,"AquilesCanta,AquilesCanta,AquilesCanta,ojw28,ojw28",2016-02-01 14:17:16,2016-02-04 19:18:23

IS,Incorrect track duration reported for some MP4 streams using mutliple timescale values,First of all thanks to all for creating this library it really accelerates android video stream application development As discovered the exoplayer version 1 5 5 it does not seem to report the correct duration for some of my MP4 streams Some investigation on my side shows the mp4 files the player is having issues with are using different timescale values for the audio and video tracks Not sure if this is completely compliant with the mp4 spec So I can not really judge if this is problem with the files or a limitation bug in the mp4 parser Anyway traced it down to the extractor mp4 AtomParsers java parseTrak method In the parseTrak method it seems to use the timescale from the mvhd box together with the duration as reported in the tkhd box which for my files with will result in a wrong duration in us for the track in the container that is using a different timescale value then specified in the mvhd box I'm not an expert in MP4 but assuming mp4 allows to use different timescales as it is reported in mutliple places it seems more logical to use the timescale from the mdhd box specific to a track instead of using the timescale value from the mvhd box for calculating the track duration in Us For my files to start working correctly it was sufficient to simply use mdhdData first instead of movieTimescale variable to calculate durationUs Will unfortunately not be allowed to share the videos having the issue thanks to content copyright Found mp4 files in which the track duration in tkhd is related to the timescale of mvhd and found files where the duration in tkhd is related to the mdhd so safer seems to be to either take it completely from mdhd or mvhd,,ojw28,2016-03-02 14:52:36,2016-03-06 21:21:51

IS,Live channel example,Dear ExoPlayer devs Our company use ExoPlayer for a wild in order to switch our library to use it It works fine however there are some issues that are critical for the production version such that BehindLiveWindowException and freezing in the buffering state Both of them described already more less here via different use cases BehindLiveWindowException happening quite often and in the beginning of playback which is very strange Buffering freezing happening after a long time playing and it is causing by AudioTrack this issue reported already here by other devs What we did is we compare performance of our Live stream with the web player that is provided by Google as well it is Shaka Player and there are no issues at all hours streaming without stopping buffering for a wild etc which is minimizing chances that something wrong with content itself Counting all written above I would like to ask is there a Live channel available to test from you guys Like you provided a lot of examples for the VideOnDemand content It can be any channel not necessary a real one could be stream from web cam etc I think a lot of devs need it as well as ExoPlayer is using not only for VOD content Thanks in advance,,"ojw28,ojw28",2016-03-24 18:18:47,2016-03-28 21:49:09

IS,ExoPlayer SurfaceView in RecyclerView performance issue,I am almost sure that my problem is more related to SurfaceView and how its content is rendered than ExoPlayer itself but I still think this is the place most likely to get me a competent response I hope you do not mind that I ask it here I have a RecyclerView where each item contains the SurfaceView into which an instance of ExoPlayer is rendering its output Now when I quickly scroll the RecyclerView the contents of the SurfaceView seem to lag behind the actual position of the SurfaceView itself Which is to say the padding window around the SurfaceView moves exactly parallel to the scrolling motion but the video image itself moves a bit slower and needs some frames to catch up I have made a short video demonstrating the effect Pay attention to the black bars above and below the video while I am scrolling The video was made on an LG G2 The effect was much less noticable on a Nexus 6P but may not completely absent So my question Is this just a performance issue resulting from the way SurfaceView is drawn or is it an indication that I am doing something wrong,,"ojw28,ojw28",2016-06-03 17:41:49,2016-06-06 18:09:07

IS,Add rawResponse field to BaseChunkSampleSourceEventListener onLoadCompleted,Our backend can insert several custom fields into the manifest of a video stream which we need to interpret at playback time It does not make sense to have ExoPlayer read parse and understand these fields but it would be nice if we could read them as they are downloaded by the player In order to solve this problem we would like to add a field called rawResponse to the method signature for the onLoadCompleted event callback which would contains the raw bytes downloaded for that request and would be populated for any files that have the type set to Chunk TYPE MANIFEST i e DASH or HLS manifest files Alternately if you can think of an alternate way to accomplish this same goal we would be more than willing to explore that path,,"ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28",2016-04-04 20:29:03,2016-06-09 15:30:24

IS,HLS parsing assumes manifest resolution is actual video resolution,The DefaultHlsTrackSelector makes use of VideoFormatSelectorUtil selectVideoFormatsForDefaultDisplay to filter which playlist variants it considers as playable by the device As you follow the code through it ends up making use of isFormatPlayable with the Format being the one built from the playlist which eventually ends up in MediaCodecUtil isSizeAndRateSupportedV21 or MediaCodecUtil isSizeSupportedV21 specifying the width and height defined within the playlist This seems to suggest that the code is assuming the playlist resolution is the actual video resolution that needs to be decoded However the HLS spec actually suggests something different This can lead to an issue where the manifest can correctly define a display resolution that includes potentially odd valued heights or widths We originally found this when attempting to play a video via HLS where the manifest reported a resolution of 720x405 with the actual video having an actual resolution of 720x404 The variant is being stripped because the MediaCodecInfo will report that it can not handle this resolution due to the mWidthAlignment or mHeightAlignment requirements However as mentioned earlier this is a display resolution not the actual video resolution,,"IanDBird,ojw28,ojw28",2016-03-02 10:45:20,2016-06-09 23:08:33

PR,WIP Add SequenceSampleSource for playing multiple sources back to back,Seamless playback is the goal of this pull request without even the slightest gap Multiple people are trying to achieve a playlist like functionality with either ExoPlayer or MediaPlayer see for example MediaPlayer MediaPlayer MediaPlayer Some of these questions are about simple audio playlists some for video playlists What I'm trying to do is create an application like a very lightweight variant of Apple is iMovie So basically play 2 or more video files stored locally with 0 frames gap On iOS the AVFoundation framework provides these features and it works easily and performs well On Android implementations that rely on substituting the ExoPlayer or it is data sources do not perform well in our tests either release prepare cycles or having a spare player stand ready Even on modern devices tested old new devices there exists a noticeable freeze The SequenceSampleSource is an effort to solve this issue It wraps multiple SampleSources so that buffering is continued cross video and the video timeline is seekable as a whole The inner clip durations would be available for keeping track of which video is played currently or another listener could be implemented both options are fine by me I am completely open for feedback and would love to solve this 'problem' for the Android platform The ultimate goal would be to have something like this in the MediaPlayer interface something as simple as this The code in this pull request is not finished It is inspired by the HLS playback but my knowlegde of video data formats and the internal defacto ExoPlayer lifecycle ways is lacking Known bugs Although first playback works fine after seeking the video tends to jump upon clip transition After first seek some clip transitions seem to lack a keyframe we see typical behaviour like when normal frame differences are applied to the wrong keyframe Smudgy motions in regions that are not reset by the keyframe Any help would be wonderful,,"ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28",2015-12-16 21:13:11,2016-06-19 23:07:26

IS,ExoPlayer seekTo method only working in debug mode with breakpoints,I'm currently using an ExoPlayer within Android Studio to play mp4 videos within my app initially if the app was minimized or back grounded while the video was loaded the media player would completely stop and when the app was re opened it was unusable and the activity had to be restarted I managed to solve this problem by releasing the player when the activity was back grounded then when the app is reopened i check to see if the player is null and if so I instantiate it I then use the seekTo method to try and get the video to resume from where it was when the app was left I have the videos position stored correctly as the seekTo method works when the code is ran in debug mode with breakpoints but it does not work without break points Currently when the app is opened back up the video restarts from the beginning which is not ideal I have tested my code on Android 6 0 and 4 1 Sony Xperia Z5 and an Android Tablet and the problem occurs on both apis Here is my onPause method image Here is my onResume image Here is my preparePlayer image The code works when a break point is put on the mPlayer getPlayerControl seekTo mVideoPosition in the onResume Unfortunately i'm not that experienced with this so i'm not too sure what the problem could be on my side but I'm aware of the life cycle activities go through and with the implementation of these methods the player should run fine as it does when break points are used There is no error within the logs and I have managed to follow the program through up until it hits the seekTo within ExoPlayer java I have been outputting to the log so I know the code gets that far but obviously I cannot debug the ExoPlayer java seekTo Any more information please feel free to ask,,ojw28,2016-06-27 08:21:09,2016-06-28 08:39:24

IS,Widevine and unique device id,I want to limit the number of devices that a user can use to play DRM content I am using Widevine so my question is is Exoplayer adding some unique device identifier to the licence request I can see in the body request some bytes at the beginning that are always the same independently on the content which could mean some kind of identifier and a device id tag i e device id 4CAF609C86F Are some of them the identifiers In other hand my Widevine support tell us that we can use privacyMode enabled in the DRM session So there is a first request to get a certificate to obscure a second request which will return the valid licence Is there something in Exoplayer managing this Are those two requests thrown automatically by the Exoplayer or should we do it manually The version of ExoPlayer being used r1 5 5 Regards Marco,,ojw28,2016-06-23 09:57:02,2016-07-26 21:38:18

IS,Missing segments at the end of the period are perhaps incorrectly considered a playback failure,I have a video here that fails near the end with a 404 It plays fine most of the video but when playing the last half minute of the video we run into this Video URL The 404 comes from the 223rd video segment which does not exist ExoPlayer gets a 404 and then immediately signals the error to the app and closes up shop Running the timing numbers tells me that there should be 223 segments for all adaptation sets The audio duration is a bit less than the duration of the others 3 989s VS 4s but it still comes out to 223 total In practice however there are only 222 segments in the video stream Now the spec purist in me immediately says Hey DASH does not allow missing segments unless you are using SegmentTimeline so fix your video Unfortunately this situation uneven adaptation sets with some being shorter than the period is very common with VOD content produced by the various available encoders Therefore I would expect players to be more lenient here and ignore missing segments This is what dash js does for example it plays the segments that exist and simply ignores the ones that are missing in the end without signaling a failure A different but related scenario is live video where missing segments are a common thing that occurs when network disruptions happen between the encoder and the origin server I have not tested ExoPlayer with regard to this scenario but maybe it is worth tackling two birds with one stone and ensuring that ExoPlayer does its best to skip past missing segments in all scenarios,,"Bastian35022,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28",2015-10-02 12:10:58,2016-08-08 13:45:22

IS,Restrict All Background Data,Hello I have developed a music application that uses ExoPlayer for HLS streaming in a service Up until around June it was going great We had great reviews and our customers were subscribing at good rates All of a sudden cancellations doubled people left nasty comments and we had reports of the player suddenly stopping After a TON of troubleshooting updating ExoPlayer working on some other pieces of the app improving just about everything possible we finally captured an error ECONNREFUSED After much more server side trouble shooting I fired up ADB proxied through my desktop and started watching the traffic Everything was working perfect until the application went into the background MADEUREKA 2016 08 15 It appears that this is now enabled by default on SOME Samsung phones Hence the explosion of angry users Is there a way to handle this within Exo I have not had any luck tracking down much information about this new setting works or how people are handling the scenario Any advice is much appreciated Honestly I'm a bit shell shocked that this was the issue after all this time spent debugging,,"ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28",2016-08-16 12:46:39,2016-08-23 18:41:52
IS,Video only i e no audio live streams do not start playing when not starting at t 0,For pure live video content i e without audio track playback starts with a long buffering interval This is caused by the difference in media time of the StandaloneMediaClock always 0 initially and the much higher media time of the incoming video content Somehow the media start time of the video content is not propagated into the StandaloneMediaClock its member setPositionUs is only called once in the demo app caused by the call player seekTo playerPosition in the preparePlayer function in the PlayerActivity with the initial playerPosition 0 This effect can also be observed with static content if the media start time is much higher than 0 I have a hard time thinking of a way to easily fix this Will this issue be resolved If not i would be happy about some guidance where to start I only tested this behavior for DASH MP4 AVC if that is relevant,,"Bastian35022,ojw28,ojw28",2015-09-04 14:14:50,2016-08-23 19:42:55

IS,ChunkSampleSource can become stuck in isPendingReset state when switching the audio track,We are seeing some random stalls of the player when swithing audio tracks with MS Smoothstream content After some research into the logic it seems that the issue is related to the isPendingReset state which is kept in a true state after an audio track switch L596 I have been able to track the below order of events within ChunkSampleSource when a track is switched 1 enable L182 method is called to enable to new track which triggers restartFrom 2 restartFrom L307 method is called which sets the pendingResetPositionUs value and triggers updateLoadControl 3 updateLoadControl L423 is called which should trigger maybeStartLoading L460 to correctly continue playback the problem is that on our failure cases maybeStartLoading is not called the reason is that nextLoader L448 is returning false the logs seem to indicate that player is at that moment still fetching finishing a fragment from the previous track Now the problem is that if the player fails to call maybeStartLoading the player is stuck in an endless loop as the pendingResetPositionUs is not correctly reset Could it be that the player is missing a fallback mechanism for this scenario Utilising exoplayer 1 5 7 Below some logs Unsuccessful track switch 04 12 18 30 24 100 6529 7208 com mmm sbx D SampleSourceTrackRender

IS,Reloading of segments during HLS playback,Hello We use ExoPlayer 1 5 3 for HLS playback We noticed that after waiting for a stream to buffer if we put the device in airplane mode and then attempt to seek the operation never completes To help debug we changed our DataSource implementation to OkHttpDataSource We are able to monitor the requests by its backing OkHttpClient instance using Stetho What we noticed is that when the video loads for the first time on a high bandwidth connection all segments are aggressively loaded This appears to coincide with the apparent buffering But upon seeking to any position all segments at and after the seek time are reloaded From one seek operation From another seek operation This was surprising to us We assumed that the buffered segments were somehow being cached likely on disk A cursory search revealed the Cache interface but only an in memory implementation and no found uses Our solution right now is to continue using the OkHttpDataSource implementation and to configure its backing OkHttpClient instance with an on disk LRU cache However from best we can understand this cache is not particularly helpful for longer videos where the sum of all segment sizes exceeds the on disk cache size For example consider a hypothetical video with 100 segments each of size 1MB Say the on disk cache is 50MB and can therefore hold at most 50 segments Because ExoPlayer attempts to load all segments upon initial playback and the cache is LRU then after all segments are loaded the cache will hold segments 51 100 even though at this time playback may only be on segment 10 because the speed at which segments are loaded far exceeds the playback speed Therefore if the user pauses the video and rewinds it 10 seconds to review some concept that segment is a cache miss and the reloading sequence in the images above happens Do you have any advice for handling large videos like this Is the reloading behavior in the images above an ExoPlayer bug If not is there any way to control the preloading behavior of segments so that it is not so aggressive This would lead to a higher likelihood that the segments near the current playback time are in the on disk cache and so the user rewinding the video 10 seconds or skipping ahead a bit will result in a cache hit The HLS stream in the above screenshots is Thanks,,"AquilesCanta,ojw28,AquilesCanta",2016-01-27 02:20:49,2016-09-08 13:00:19

IS,Issues playing a local URI video recorded on Nexus 5X Android 7 0,This is a very strange issue as it only appears on Nexus 5X running Android 7 0 My best guess is it is related to having several SurfaceView s initialised at the same time In an essence my app is a Camera app and I'm using ExoPlayer to preview videos after recording After recording the video I replace the video capture fragment which contains the camera preview surface with the video preview fragment My video player fragment will init an instance of ExoPlayer and will attempt to start the playback using a local ContentProvider Uri object and ExtractorRendererBuilder The video player fragment will also have its own SurfaceView to work with Like I said works fine on all the phones I have tested with apart from N5X on 7 This is what I get out of ordinary on that device I have done a significant ammount of testing and noticed that what I see on my surface instead of the video playback is the last frame of the Camera capture surface I have checked my code and because my Camera surface is not created as part of the fragment lifecycle it is also not destroyed at the point when the preview playback surface is created So I end up with two SurfaceView s active and available I have also checked that the correct preview surface is used when I start the playback in the preview fragment and it is Also the preview fragment is layered on top of the camera capture fragment However I still see the last camera frame rather than the video playback Just to triple check I have removed all views from my camera preview container to trigger distruction of the surface before initialising my video preview fragment and it finally worked as expected as in the video was played correctly I do not mind removing the views from my camera capture container probably a good thing anyway however I'm confused to why this behaviour is happening and why is it only on that specific device or OS level or both,,ojw28,2016-09-19 11:52:08,2016-09-22 10:20:50

IS,RFC Extending dash manifest with custom data,This is not a question with ExoPlayer per se but since I know there is a lot of DASH knowledge here I hope I can reach out for some comments We are looking for a way to embed custom data into our DASH manifests Specifically for providing thumbnails for the clients To me it feels like it would fit very well in the AdaptationSet model Consider something like this The only bit that is perhaps a bit awkward is the framerate which I use to retrofit information of how many thumbnails are encoded in the given jpeg We would use our own AdaptationSet id to identify the set and extract the data necessary This seems to work just fine with ExoPlayer however Shaka fails to handle the AdaptationSet while parsing the manifest I'm trying to understand if this is a valid usage of DASH or if we should define our own app namespace in the XML and put the information under a custom element Going with the latter I would definitely have to modify ExoPlayer a bit or somehow parse the XML a second time which complicates things a bit,,"pakerfeldt,ojw28",2016-09-20 13:03:37,2016-09-22 14:01:54

be an Opus problem but I tried pinning back to the last release v1 1 3 and that did not solve the problem We have been building against the latest and greatest libopus with ExoPlayer 1 5 7 all along cloning from libopus is head at per the Exoplayer Opus extension instructions on here Googling the issue leads me to believe that it is something around the ART runtime instead of Dalvik but I can not be the first person to try this Please let me know what I could possibly be missing Any input is greatly appreciated,,"ojw28,erdemguven,erdemguven,erdemguven,erdemguven,erdemguven",2016-09-25

IS,Custom MediaExtractor based on ExoPlayer is Extractor,Question Dear ExoPlayer developers I'm not sure if this is the appropriate place to ask this question but I would love to receive some input from you guys In our app the seeking is the most crucial feature so I have been working directly with MediaCodec based on example from grafika is MoviePlayer This works fine with normal Android video but it has trouble reading iOS is mov or even mp4 video Correct me if I'm wrong but I think the key problem here is the default MediaExtractor cannot read iOS is files If I can somehow make the extractor work then I can just pass the raw data into MediaCodec for decoding as usual This blog post is like the only material regarding this matter that I can find but unfortunately the section about customized MediaExtractor is very brief I would be very appreciated if you guys can provide some general guidance as I can see ExoPlayer has no problem reading iOS is files at all Thank you so much for your time,,"ojw28,ojw28",2016-10-06 04:58:04,2016-10-09 16:02:22

IS,Subtitles can be hidden prematurely or never rendered,Issue Occasionally a subtitle will be hidden prematurely or never displayed at all Debugging the stream shows that the affected subtitles always span a text sample boundary This issue occurs when rendering subtitles that come from a streaming MP4 source I have tested using a TTML stream but it may reproduce with other formats Cause Consider two adjacent text samples Sample A starts at 03 00 000 and has a 1 minute duration Sample B starts at 04 00 000 and also has a 1 minute duration Subtitle S has a start time of 03 59 500 and an end time of 04 02 000 which spans the boundary of the two samples and it is contained in sample A Subtitle T starts at 4 03 000 and is contained in sample B When the playback position reaches 3 59 500 the TextRenderer is operating on sample A and it shows subtitle S at the correct time It should remain visible until 04 02 000 but it disappears at 04 00 000 after being shown for only 500ms TextRenderer immediately abandons sample A and switches to sample B when the playback position reaches 04 00 000 which is two seconds before the end time of subtitle S It queries sample B for subtitles at the current playback position 04 00 000 and finds no titles since sample B does not contain subtitle S and subtitle T does not start until 04 03 000 The renderer flushes the text output hiding the subtitle prematurely Workaround The least invasive change I could make to solve the issue was to modify SimpleSubtitleDecoder so that it sets the start time of every text sample to the time of the first subtitle contained within that text sample For example the sample time of B is changed from 04 00 000 to 04 03 000 As long as the time spans of S and T are not intended to overlap this should solve the problem It seems like the correct place to fix this bug is actually in TextRenderer so that even overlapping subtitles can be handled correctly However I did not know how this would affect the display of subtitles during a seek,,"ojw28,ojw28",2016-10-14 19:41:36,2016-10-14 20:51:30

IS,DASH Manifest fetcher not persisting redirect URI after 302 redirection to CDN,We had an issue with the DASH manifest fetcher not reusing the redirect URI after getting a 302 The scenario is as follows high traffic streaming platform using in house streaming servers as entry point which in case of a high load redirect the client to CDN 1 Player requests manifest from the in house server 2 In house server with a 302 redirects the player to a CDN server where the player gets the manifest Location URI is not set in the received manifest as it is not mandatory 3 After 2 seconds the player tries to fetch a new manifest again from the in house server instead of sticking to the CDN server assigned in the first call 4 In a high traffic scenario obviously this leads to an overload on the in house servers with too many continuous manifest requests from active players Setting the location URI in the manifest for the CDN servers would be impractical Is there something speaking against implementing a sticky behavior after a redirect for the manifest fetcher The chunk source sticks correctly to the received URI getting all chunks from assigned CDN server If such behavior cannot be made default would it be possible to add a flag which activates it,,"ojw28,ojw28",2016-05-17 08:29:23,2016-11-16 22:30:35

IS,After AudioTrack pause getCurrentPosition continues to progress,I have a requirement that I know the exact position of playback after the content has been paused aka after setPlayWhenReady false I have tested this both with ExoPlayer1 and ExoPlayer2 but I have more logs and data for v1 so the data throughout is for v1 although the same exact behavior reproduces under v2 My current scenario is that with exo playing I call setPlayWhenReady false I need to know exactly when playback has actually been paused and what the position of the player is at that point So I implement an ExoPlayer Listener that listens for onPlayWhenReadyCommitted and checks if what was committed was a playWhenRead true or false If I detect that playWhenReady false was committed I then query getCurrentPosition on ExoPlayer My assumption has been that at this point playback has actually stopped and getCurrentPosition will return to me the position at which playback had stopped However it looks like this is not the case Even though playWhenReady had been committed and pause had been called on the AudioTrack the next pumping of doSomeWork by ExoPlayer will result in picking up a new position from the underlying AudioTrack the AudioTrack that had previously been paused From looking at logs and the behavior it looks like AudioTrack requires one doSomeWork iteration after calling pause for it to report back the position that it had last flushed out from its buffers and has actually paused at However since this does require at least one additional doSomeWork call AFTER playWhenReadyCommitted this means there is no ExoPlayer API that exposes to the application when playback has actually paused and what the position is at that time Of course we can talk about workarounds for this like in our onPlayWhenReadyCommitted callback waiting for one second which is the doSomeWork interval in the playWhenReady false state But this has the potential to introduce noticeable application latency to the user if we have to block future user interactions on waiting for this second for the playback position to land on its final value It also makes the assumption which may or may not be valid I do not know the specifics of of AudioTrack work that we only are required to wait for one doSomeWork pump of AudioTrack not potentially more than one Here are some logs that demonstrate the problem the logs of SamplePlayer logging the position were added for debugging purposes and are done on a background thread 09 17 14 01 45 050 14007 14032 I SamplePlayer pause 09 17 14 01 45 050 14007 14033 I

PR,improve the performance of far seek,Please read in detail by the link above which includes the result of experimental comparison Here we check the side of upstream and do optimize for seek locates where Originally if the seek target is behind sampleQueue at the upstream side we will clean up the whole sampleQueue Then do refetch from the media chunk which contains the search target Obviously there is a waste for downloading redundant data If the conditions below are satisfied we could try to locate the last key frame within sampleQueue and drop the out of range decoded only samples at renderer 1 The search target locates within the last media chunk 2 The nearest key frame precedes the search target has been either within sampleQueue or sent to decoded or rendered The take use of this fact we create a new function named skipToLastKeyframe It tries to find the last key sample within the sampleQueue Also we create a function named isWithinLastChunk to check whether the seek target locates within the last media chunk Finally we skip the out of range samples at renderer by comparing to seek target The experimental result shows a 252 5 speed up to 4K movie,,WeiChungChang,2016-12-22 09:15:29,2016-12-22 09:20:14

IS,Playback fails due to integer overflow using large SegmentTemplate startNumber parameters,We have encountered a playback failure due to the wrong size variable used for the startNumber attribute Number parameters in templates per the following example from an MPD where startNumber 1480044110 You might ask why we use such large numbers we set startNumber to current timestamps according to Akamai qualification recommendations which state Segment numbers must not repeat when a live encoder restarts This can be achieved when the segment numbers are derived from current epoch time This results in always increasing segment numbers and prevents overwriting data in the storage system We worked around this by subtracting the UNIX time for 1 1 16 but I suppose there could be other encoders packagers using the literal definition from Akamai A Java 32 bit integer should be sufficient to hold epoch time but not if you add the two values together and divide by 2 to get the midpoint as the Exoplayer code does We tried a quick hack that simply used longs to prove it worked but better would be to subtract the values and divide by 2 then add to the lower value Then there is not chance of an overflow even using integers I e you should be able to fix this easily we were looking at a fork of your code from over a year ago and I'm not sure where the logic is now but you can see the problem in this older version on this line of code L147,,ojw28,2017-01-10 18:22:01,2017-01-13 17:28:44

IS,CPU load optimizations options for HLS,This is not really a bug in the sense that the HLS functionality does not work but rather options for optimization on the Exoplayer code base This based on the analysis of the 1 5 6 code So far we have encountered the worst performance to be on HLS aes encrypted content On our android 4 3 armv7 4x1ghz on gbit eth we only achieve around maximum 5mbit throughput in this mode on HLS without aes we reach around 24mbit throughput A At base of the higher HLS CPU load seems to be the design choice to do extraction during loading rather then doing extraction during playback Guess this will also be related to the 1227 question As far as we could see this would be quite a big change so we did not investigate how to improve on this Hopefully you can find an easier trick Optimally extraction would be done from memory on a loaded buffer the raw buffer itself is most optimally loaded with data intervals suiting the actual data source Making things worse for HLS is the fact that the TsExtractor does it is input stream requests in 188byte blocks Probably other modes of streaming could also benefit from optimizing this B1 When using the HLS AES 128 feature of Exoplayer Another big performance issue is with the Aea128DataSource java implementation itself on android 4 x platforms The Aea128DataSource uses a cipher is used on Android is CipherInputStream Aes Unfortunately the CipherInputStream as provided by the Android 4 x OS has a terrible throughput performance as it internally does the decryption in chuncks of only 20 bytes towards it is inputstream It would be advisable to add a better performing ExoPlayerCipherInputStream filter customized to handling the streaming data instead basically doing much more data in one go One can for instance derive it from the later platform version Some examples or B2 A smaller performance thing seems to be coming from the cipher itself The Aes128DataSource requests AES CBC PKCS7Padding which means the app will get the bouncy castle java crypto implementation on android 4 x variants on later OS versions this is translated to AES CBC PKCS5Padding by the android OS itself which then results in the faster openssl provider serving the decryption As such we guess would be more optimal to just request AES CBC PKCS5Padding in the Aes128DataSource directly see 0d1f9b857696946e23046956f8f3484acd9de84b 5E,,"ojw28,ojw28,ojw28",2016-04-04 11:20:16,2017-01-13 19:04:11

IS,Last subtitle sample being dropped by MP4 extractor,This issue is present in ExoPlayer 1 5 13 I imagine it would apply to v2 as well I have a couple MP4 videos using TX3G subtitles where the last subtitle ended well before the video ended For example the video has a duration of 100 seconds but the last subtitle should only display starting from position 70 seconds and ending at position 80 seconds I noticed a problem in that I was never getting the onCues callback to clear the last subtitle at position 80 seconds so the last subtitle ended up being incorrectly displayed all the way until the end of the video I did some investigation and debugging and found the following All the samples for the TX3G track are being properly read in parseStbl in AtomParsers java However before the TrackSampleTable is created there is code to edit and or trim down the samples based on an edit list Count the number of samples after applying edits int editedSampleCount 0 int nextSampleIndex 0 boolean copyMetadata false for int i 0 i track editListDurations length i long mediaTime track editListMediaTimes i if mediaTime 1 long duration Util scaleLargeTimestamp track editListDurations i track timescale track movieTimescale int startIndex Util binarySearchCeil timestamps mediaTime true true int endIndex Util binarySearchCeil timestamps mediaTime duration true false editedSampleCount endIndex startIndex copyMetadata nextSampleIndex startIndex nextSampleIndex endIndex copyMetadata editedSampleCount sampleCount In my case the mediaTime is 0 and the duration is 80000 ms which is the timestamp corresponding to the last sample in the TX3G track Thus endIndex ends up being the index of the last sample which is supposed to clear the last subtitle it has a size of 2 and the data is 0x00 0x00 However this causes editedSampleCount to be one less than sampleCount and thus the last sample gets dropped by the time the TrackSampleTable is created To fix this I think endIndex should be calculated this way instead with 'inclusive' being set to false int endIndex Util binarySearchCeil timestamps mediaTime duration false false Also the same change probably needs to be applied a few lines down when endIndex is calculated again I do not know how this change would impact video or audio tracks but for me this change prevented the last sample in the TX3G track from being dropped from the TrackSampleTable and I got the resulting onCues callback at position 80 seconds to clear the last subtitle Can you please look at this and advise if this change would be correct,,"andrewlewis,andrewlewis,andrewlewis",2017-02-01 19:00:46,2017-02-15 18:09:40

IS,Response to call for feature about set playback speed so called trick playback,Dear all I would like to see if anyone works on this topic and if so to see if we could provide this feature in a general way I also comment it at 26 but it may be a too old post so nobody may pay attention to it Hence I post it here again Root cause It provides my way to response the call for feature of trick playback here an acceptable way It includes 1 Locally reverse playback 2 Locally high speed playback more than X2 or X4 The patch could be applied to streaming also However I will improve the streaming case hereafter Patch It is based on a fix to include adaptive streaming case Here a simple classification to trick playback is given below 1 a locally low speed trick playback ex 4 or 2 mainly achieved by operating audio or mediaclock speed 1 b locally high speed trick playback ex 8 mainly achieved by seek 1 c locally reverse playback mainly achieved by seek 2 a low speed trick playback by streaming ex 4 or 2 2 b high speed trick playback by streaming ex 8 2 c reverse playback by streaming 1 According to this rough classification currently there may have been a scheme for 1 a there Here 1 b 1 c are tried to be accomplished Notice that even for X2 local playback for a movie with 2K resolution it still gets stuck by I O bandwidth limit as demo item 6 Test movie 2K low bit rate Demo 1 Pure 8X speed normal playback test 2 Pure 8X speed reverse playback test 3 Hybrid operations test 2X 4X 8X 8X seek when 8X normal playback X1 2X 4X 8X 8X normal playback X1 4 Reverse playback 1X test 5 2K movie reverse playback test 6 2K movie not smooth even for X2 or X4 by too high bit rate test The way to implement design To implement trick playback by see we need 1 Trigger seek internally 2 Calculate the next seek position 3 Decide the show time of each displayed frame A simple way to implement is to create a standalone MediaClock instance at the control layer Set a default display time by ex 500 ms When high speed trick playback starts ex x8 1 we set corresponding time current playback time speed x8 to StandaloneMediaClock starts it 2 deliver the first seek target is current position 3 When the frame rendered it takes some time arrange the next seek to be triggered after 500 ms set the seek target to current position speed display time Step 3 recursively triggers seek to next position according to the playback speed Finally for fast forward if the target exceeds movie duration or for backward playback the target is less than 0 the playback is complete so we stop delivering next seek To evaluate if a design of trick playback is good enough the criterion may be 1 If the frames displayed well demonstrate the critical scene of this movie 2 The displayed time is long enough to let the audiences to capture the instance they are interested in In fact there are a lot of ways to do it A recent work could be referred below US20150016804 pdf Since Android is an open system which is adopted on a lot of devices it is hard to predict the format such as GOP setting key frame interval bit rate of the movie to be played I think it is one of the reasons why iOS could provide much better operation experience than Android At next step I will include the design for streaming I will be glad if someone is interested in implementing it also You could leave your valuable suggestions directly to me here Thanks,,"WeiChungChang,ojw28,WeiChungChang",2017-02-21 05:53:57,2017-02-21 10:18:33
IS,Offlining video with encryption,I'm not using the template because I'm not filing a bug report or reporting an issue bur rather requesting a wiki sample documentation or some form of direction First thanks to all the contributors for the time and work they'v invested this is a great product and I appreciate what is involved in maintaining it This is not a bug report so much of a request for direction The question seems common playing non HLS offline encrypted video I think a simple MVP would go a long way Hopefully this would not take too long for someone who knows what they are doing In our case we allow users to download a video to internal or external storage but need to encrypt it so that it is not distributed Last year using ExoPlayer 1 I was able to do this successfully with the RC4 algorithm and a simple CipherInputStream in a custom DataSource However seeking was extremely slow 5 10 20 seconds IIUC because the encrypted stream needed to be read from the beginning of the file Fast forward to this month using ExoPlayer 1 again initially I quickly moved to ExoPlayer 2 I was able to modify the bytes in the input and output buffers successfully so could make the content non playable by flipping bits and grunging but of course this is not secure at all In exploring other strategies it looks like some modes allow random read access server so I moved to AES CTR NoPadding and ExoPlayer 2 which is the same algorithm used by AesCipherDataSource All of my subsequent attempts have used this algorithm My first attempt was to use the AesCipherDataSource with my encrypted content I encrypted the file in app using standard stream methods and copied it to assets While the IV was different since AesFlushingCipher makes its own IV in the constructor the key was the same and to my understanding it should have been able to decrypt but it failed with None of the available extractors which I have come to learn usually means the decryption failed I was hopeful here and am curious why this failed I'm confident the encryption did not fail because I was able to decrypt and read it with alternate approaches details follow although none worked perfectly I was able to consistently get at least playback and decrypting the same file immediately afterward and playing it with standard DataSource also worked I then tried modifying both AesFlushingCipher and AesCipherDataSource to allow me to pass in my own cipher instance This got closer I had playback but seeking will throw an error IIRC it would always error when seeking to a point previous to last played and sometimes when seeking otherwise TBH this was many attempts back and I might be misremembering the specifics of the failure but I did fail Returning to the original strategy of using a CipherInputStream basically copying AssetDataSource with a CipherInputStream around it again provided close but not quite results playback was fine but seeking would sometimes throw errors If you scrubbed gently gave it plenty of time to warm up only moved forward in small increments it would work reasonably well but seeking immediately or seeking backwards would almost always throw an error Top bit not zero FWIW I'm using the same sample video I used for the RC4 version last year During those investigations I tried several different files and believe the inconsistency is not because of the file an 11MB mp4 Would it be possible to provide a working example of a DataSource reading encrypted local files I would really appreciate any insight or direction Thanks again,,"ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,andrewlewis",2017-02-17 15:51:53,2017-02-21 15:58:06

IS,MediaSource for on demand transcoded streams,I have a HTTP server which can transcode video files to h264 aac Matroska streams and deliver them live to the client Using an ExtractorMediaSource I can play those streams just fine but as expected the duration is unknown and seeking is not available Said server can also be queried for amongst other stuff the duration of the video files For the transcoding a query parameter accepting the start time is supported and the server will deliver a stream from that time to the end of the source file So to support seeking I figured a custom MediaSource is due What I currently have is a thin wrapper around ExtractorMediaSource which works like this in prepareSource it queries the server about the stream duration and calls back to the source listener with a new SinglePeriodTimeline duration true in createPeriod it instantiates the underlying ExtractorMediaSource using the positionUs parameter to figure out the proper query parameter for the starting time and returns a MediaPeriod created by that source This already gives me proper duration display but seeking does not work the createPeriod method is called only once with positionUs 0 An attempt to seek causes the playback to start from the beginning Obviously what I'm doing is not sufficient to communicate the specifics of my server to ExoPlayer but honestly I'm a bit lost where to go from here Is my TimeLine the problem or passing through the MediaPeriod both of them PS I could not dig out a mailing list IRC channel for ExoPlayer so please forgive I'm spamming the issue tracker with this,,"andrewlewis,andrewlewis,andrewlewis",2017-02-21 16:42:58,2017-02-25 20:52:10

IS,DASH Issues playing DVR live streams,I have been trying to make MPD DVR live streams work with Exoplayer 2 1 1 but the behavior is abnormal When loading the stream with that manifest format the player shows on first load the duration and progress in negative values then the progress values change to positive values but the duration remains negative and since the time is negative the hours mark gets lost as per L572 The stream plays only for 5 seconds equivalent to the length of the segments in the manifest and then the playback ends with no way to resume However the player is still working and loading the next segments correctly after the playback ended but since the playback timers are all broken the player thinks it reached or got past the end and does not continue playing or allow resume at least this is what I assume is happening I have also tried with HLS DVR format the exact same live stream and it plays perfectly The timers display correctly the timeline scrubber stays at the end position the user can seek back in time and the playback does not halt after the first segment is played In short the experience with this format is perfect The problem is that I think HLS is not compatible with some devices where MPD would be which is why I would prefer to have both working in case one is not compatible with the user device unless I am wrong about this I have always been following the manifest structures YouTube uses since I assume their formats are compatible with Exoplayer they usually standard these things and saves me a lot of time At first I thought I was building my MPD DVR manifests incorrectly but when I tested Exoplayer with YouTube is own manifest untouched I discovered the exact same problems were present ruling out the possibility of errors committed on my end during manifest structuring I cannot provide the method of doing it via YouTube since it could encourage other users to misuse the YouTube service other than for debugging purposes so if you need this I can exchange this information privately Is this behavior known expected Is there a way to fix it on my end or is it a bug with the player Also am I wrong in assuming some devices can be incompatible with HLS I ask this because if any MPD compatible device is also compatible with HLS then finding a fix for this problem becomes low priority,,"AquilesCanta,AquilesCanta,AquilesCanta,AquilesCanta,AquilesCanta,AquilesCanta,ojw28,ojw28",2017-02-04 13:28:23,2017-02-28 15:59:13

PR,Allow out of tree builds,Before modularisation of the code it was possible to do an out of tree build giving an PbuildDir someDir argument to gradle With the modularisation it is broken as using PbuildDir someDir will force the same directory for each sub projects which breaks the gradle build system This commit adds a new externalBuildDir project property to allow out of tree builds again When set it updates the buildDir property for each project to point to externalBuildDir project name That way the build artefacts are written in the out of tree directory in a project specific folder To do an out of tree build use gradle PexternalBuildDir someDir It supports absolute and relative path Relative path are interpreted against the ExoPlayer root directory The patch has been tested with absolute and relative path The call to hasProperty needs to explicit the it message receiver due to gradle issue 1826,,canatella,2017-04-21 09:46:24,2017-04-21 16:55:57

IS,Come up with good solution for attaching detaching surface from video renderers,Great work great library thanks for all your hard work A description of the issue itself This was first discovered when using ExoPlayer and backgrounded video audio continues to play in a Service while the Activity is paused We found that on most devices the onPlaybackStateChange callback for STATE ENDED was not called when the Activity was paused but would fire as soon as the Activity resumed On some devices e g HTC One X 4 1 1 STATE ENDED happened as expected even with the Activity backgrounded paused For example 1 Create an Activity that has a TextureView 2 Create a Service that creates an ExoPlayer instance 3 Start the Service from the Activity setting the surface of the ExoPlayer to the TextureView Attach a Listener to the ExoPlayer that logs out state changes 4 Play any video 5 Allow the video to get near the end then hit the HOME button 6 The audio continues but the onPlaybackStateChange callback for STATE ENDED does not fire on most devices 7 Resume the Activity select it from the multi task app switcher 8 The onPlaybackStateChange callback for STATE ENDED will now fire as the Activity resumes The cause is 1 ExoPlayerImplInternal calls doSomeWork where it checks if each renderer is done by calling isEnded on each renderer If all renderers report that they are ended and meet some other conditions it fires onPlaybackStateChange with STATE ENDED 2 MediaCodecTrackRenderer is isEnded method returns outputStreamEnded which is apparently not set to true in most devices for MediaCodeVideoTrackRenderer instances if there is not a surface to send to When the surface is replaced it correctly and immediately reports outputStreamEnded isEnded to be true so doSomeWork does indeed call onPlaybackStateChange to STATE ENDED Steps describing how the issue can be reproduced ideally in the ExoPlayer demo app 1 Create an app using a VideoPlaybackActivity and a BackgroundAudioService 2 Add a video to assets Update the path in VideoPlaybackActivity to that video 3 Run the VideoPlaybackActivity 4 Allow the video to get near the end then hit the HOME button 5 The audio continues but the onPlaybackStateChange callback for STATE ENDED does not fire on most devices 6 Resume the Activity select it from the multi task app switcher 7 The onPlaybackStateChange callback for STATE ENDED will now fire as the Activity resumes 8 Comment out or remove the line that set the surface to null in VideoPlaybackActivity onSurfaceTextureDestroyed 9 Repeat steps 3 and 4 Now since the surface was not made unavailable to the video renderer the onPlaybackStateChange will fire for STATE ENDED while the Activity is paused If the issue only reproduces with certain content a link to some content that we can use to reproduce If you don t wish to post a link publicly please send the link by email to dev exoplayer gmail com including the issue number in the subject line n a The version of ExoPlayer being used 1 5 7 The device s and version s of Android on which the issue can be reproduced and how easily it reproduces Does it happen every time or only occassionally If possible please test on multiple devices and Android versions If the issue does not reproduce on some combinations that s useful information We have tested on multiple devices including Nexus 5 Nexus 6 Nexus 7 Samsung Galaxy 6 and HTC One X So far only the HTC One X on 4 1 1 did not exhibit the behavior the video track renderer ended with or without a surface to draw too It is predictable and reproducible it never happens on the HTC One X and always happens on the other devices A full bug report taken from the device just after the issue occurs attached to the issue as a file A bug report can be captured from the command line using adb bugreport bugreport txt Note that the output from adb logcat or a log snippet is typically not sufficient n a Anything else you think might be relevant The proper way to get around this is to re use the SurfaceTexture so that it is always available to the MediaCodeVideoTrackRenderer even if it is not onscreen and return false from onSurfaceTextureDestroyed so that it is not released That said the behavior described above does seem like it could be corrected to behave like I think most users would expect the audio renderer correctly reported when it had ended which is when the media item as a single entity had concluded I believe it should have reported STATE ENDED at that time Thanks and let me know if you need any more information,,"ojw28,ojw28,ojw28",2016-05-10 21:58:43,2017-05-11 00:10:08

IS,Synchronization issue with applying specific effects on HLS video stream using ExoPlayer,Hi I am playing an HLS video stream in my android app using ExoPlayer Everything works fine except for one particular scenario where I suppose it is a synchronization related artifact So in my app I am trying to add some effect e g zoom effect or some rotation effect on the hls video stream at particular time instants The video stream I have is 30fps For example each of my HLS segment is 1 second long And I want to apply such effects starting at HLS segment number 12 or at the starting of 12th second in the stream So what I do in my app is I call getCurrentPosition which should return current playback position I have placed this call inside OnDrawFrame which is called every time the screen is refreshed which is roughly 60 times per second on my S7 So in my app I have some thing like this onDrawFrame float v called periodically every 0 016666666666667 seconds check if current playback position has just crossed 12 seconds mark if player getCurrentPosition 12000 code to apply new effects This code works fine for the most part But I see that the new effect is either delayed or advanced by couple of frames and not being applied right at the first frame of the 12th segment This is not always the case but happens roughly 50 of the time And I see a very quick flicker when this happens Any suggestions on what I am missing here How to make sure that the new effects I am applying are being applied exactly from the first frame of 12th segment I see the same behavior on S6 S7 and Pixel Thanks a lot in advance Shalin,,"andrewlewis,ojw28",2017-04-28 20:25:13,2017-05-24 14:22:34

IS,Synchronizing Multiple ExoPlayers,Hello I'm working on using ExoPlayer for a custom VR video streaming application I want to be able to play media from multiple DASH sources to different SurfaceTextures which will be put into an OpenGL shader to be warped and displayed in VR I know how to do the OpenGL part already Each DASH source corresponds to a different tile or quadrant of the VR video I have been able to play my tiles using separate SimpleExoPlayer instances but there is not a way to synchronize those so the tiles would be out of sync I have tried a couple things to get this working I setup a DashMediaSource and tried to read samples directly from the sample streams and put them into MediaCodec on my own I did this by creating a MediaPeriod from the DashMediaSource and once it was prepared I selected a track from it Whenever there is data available I read it into the decoder and set the right flags This did not work In fact it was so bad that the phone would reset whenever I ran the code I think there might have been a problem with the initialization of the MediaCodec but the debugger was not too useful so after a week of trying to debug it I gave up I can paste some code if that idea has promise and it is just a matter of debugging I tried modifying MediaCodecVideoRenderer to keep DecoderOutputBuffers around until I wanted to render them This also did not work What I want to know is is there a way I can either synchronize SimpleExoPlayer or ExoPlayer instances If I can not do that I would like to be able to get a sample stream that I can put into a MediaCodec instance myself and handle the playback and synchronization myself Thanks in advance for any help,,ojw28,2017-05-22 22:06:45,2017-05-31 09:42:43

IS,Crossfade implementation question,Hello I want to implement a BPM matching Crossfade feature using Exoplayer Basically I have a concept how it should work but I'm not sure which Exoplayer classes to modify to achieve my goals Let me please first write how I want to do this so you can understand the case As you probably know BPM Crossfade let to seamlessly switch from one song to another Additionally it adjusts second song tempo to first song tempo during the crossfade So the plan is as follows 1 Load song A and B so they both starts to buffer 2 Decoded samples of song A and B are stored in buffers BF1 and BF2 3 There is a class called MUX which is a main buffer and contains both songs buffers BF1 and BF2 MUX provides audio samples to the Player Samples provided to the Player are BF1 samples or mixed samples from BF1 and BF2 if there is a crossfade 4 If buffer reach the crossfade point then samples are send to Analyser class so it can analyse samples from both buffers and modify them for crossfade Analyser sends modified samples to MUX which updated it is main buffer 5 When crossfade is finished load next song from playlist So basically which class to extend to create class like MUX Should it be some custom MediaSource How can I access BF1 and BF2 I have also read somewhere that you do not anymore buffer songs that are not active How can I overcome this as I want to manage second song buffer I hope you can guide me a little bit I decided to ask question here and not on StackOverflow as you have much deeper knowledge of ExoPlayer structure Thanks in advance for any help,,ojw28,2017-06-13 17:09:37,2017-06-15 14:14:43

IS,Black screen when recreating SurfaceView,I have seen this issue already reported a few times specially this one 1084 but all of them involve using TextureView which is not an option for us The way to reproduce it is similar as the other issues reported by destroying and recreating the SurfaceView where once the method player setPlayWhenReady true is called the Audio starts playing but the onDrawnToSurface surface takes around 3 seconds to be called I added this code on the OnCreate of the PlayerActivity on the demo app from ExoPlayer It is more noticeable when playing the BipBop video After adding that code and installing the app play the video After 6 seconds the video will stop for 5 seconds After resuming the audio will start playing and the video will play around 3 seconds later I tested it on a Nexus 5 5 1 and a HTC One 5 1 Is there an optimized way to get around that,,"Ood-Tsen,ojw28",2016-06-15 14:41:40,2017-06-24 13:10:56

IS,Reduce memory footprint by disabling ID3 parser,Hi while I was investigating OOM issues within a podcast player app I noticed that most of the generated stack traces comes from ExoPlayer I know that in this case a stack trace only show the location in the code that failed to allocate the memory and it does not necessarily mean that place in the code is the source of the issue but then I found this and I found strange that ExoPlayer was trying to allocate 10MB at once so I checked some of the MP3 files and I noticed that some of them embeds very large images in the ID3 header For example this is around 13MB In my case my app does not need any of this data because we analyze the files on the server side beforehand extracting all the metadata that we made available to the app via our API so parsing the ID3 is totally useless for us and it waste a lot of memory that on low end device is quite a big deal I checked the code and I could not find any clue about a configuration to disabling the ID3 parser in the MP3 extractor Am I missing something Is it something possible to integrate in the next releases Thanks Rocco,,"ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28",2017-03-13 17:37:33,2017-06-24 13:23:28

IS,Improve video start time when using lower buffer size in LoadControl,I'm upgrading from ExoPlayer r 1 5 9 to r 2 2 0 and wondering if I can use and suppy buffer size lower than default values LoadControl implementation DefaultLoadControl has a targetBufferSize which is calculated when a track is selected and it is equal to sum of default values of renderers present in the selected track In a typical track there would be four renderers video 12 5 MB DEFAULT VIDEO BUFFER SIZE audio 3 375 MB DEFAULT AUDIO BUFFER SIZE text 128 KB DEFAULT TEXT BUFFER SIZE meta data 128 KB DEFAULT METADATA BUFFER SIZE and equal to 16 125 MB In the earlier exoplayer version buffer size can be supplied through HlsSampleSource and it was around 3 MB which is four or five times lesser than current target buffer size and android memory monitor showed that the app with ExoPlayer 2 2 0 uses an extra memory of 5 to 10 MB Objective Decrease the memory usage of the app and bring it closer to exo player r1 5 9 Questions 1 Is it recommended to create a custom LoadControl to address the higher memory usage 2 If creating a custom LoadControl is recommended then what could be a minimum buffer size that can be used that does not affect video start time time required to see the first frame after clicking load button 3 Does reducing buffer size affects increases video start time If so what part of the exo player r2 2 0 should I address to decrease video start time 4 Does changing DefaultAllocator default buffer size from 64 KB to 256 KB has any affect on above scenario I have tried to address the memory usage by creating a custom LoadControl that takes targetBufferSize which is closer to old exo player buffer size but I have noticed some delay in seeing the first frame after hitting load button Also there was no significant drop in memory usage DefaultAllocator used is 256 KB Please advice on recommended steps or documentation regarding targetBufferSize and LoadControl,,"ojw28,ojw28",2017-05-16 14:52:21,2017-06-24 13:30:42

IS,Tunneling support on API 23 does not start renderer,Issue description Tunneled playback does not start on at least some API 23 Devices and the player stays in buffering state It looks to me like the MediaCodec OnFrameRenderedListener that is used on API 23 to trigger maybeNotifyRenderedFirstFrame is not triggered if the AudioTrack is not started That in turn causes video render to report that it is not ready since isReady relies on the renderedFirstFrame when in tunneling mode causing the renders not to be enabled which means the AudioTrack is never started and the player stays in buffering state An easy fix to confirm the issue was to use the 23 behaviour and call maybeNotifyRenderedFirstFrame in onQueueInputBuffer of the MediaCodecVideoRenderer i e Please note that with the fix above the attached OnFrameRenderedListener is indeed triggered so it is not that the listener is not working at all it just seems that on the devices I tested the tunneling implementation is indeed waiting for the first AV sync header on the AudioTrack before rendering the first frame and triggering the listener hence it seems like this can not be used reliably as a first frame indicator Maybe I missed something or maybe there is a better workaround but to me it would make sense to remove the listener approach and fallback to the 23 behaviour and trigger the first frame notification when input is queued and tunneling is enabled I would appreciate any thoughts on this and I'm happy to prepare a PR for any potential fix Reproduction steps Enable tunneling in the Demo Application and try to play any of the demo content on an API 23 device Link to test content Can be reproduced with any of the demo content Version of ExoPlayer being used Tested and reproduces with 2 4 2 and dev v2 commit 8af77acb01edbcc7fe7005d44a0146e25c6695eb Device s and version s of Android being used The devices I could reproduce this with is a Sony Bravia 4K 2015 API 23 and a Technicolor Skipper API 23 A full bug report captured from the device Happy to send one if it is required for this issue,,"andrewlewis,ojw28",2017-06-22 10:02:15,2017-07-05 16:23:29

IS,Handle connection loss,Hello team This is a suggestion for improvements correct me if I am wrong in my request The issue is that when connection interrupts for a short period few seconds the Player throws playback exception even though there is buffered data available Quick example is turn WiFi off and on Real use case is when live stream consumes for instance Internet radio station and vehicle drives via dead zones Currently I am handle this case in onPlaybackError callback however this is workaround and as soon as buffered data played and even though connection restored Player dispatch state completed and it is necessary to re start playback Feature request is to handle such cases internally in Player unless there is no buffered data available Regards Yurii,,ojw28,2017-07-06 00:02:14,2017-07-06 07:37:09

IS,How can I implement adaptation algorithms that have access to information about the last downloaded DASH segment chunk,I would like to implement custom DASH video adaptation algorithms in ExoPlayer where the algorithms have access to information about each segment downloaded mainly the size the position in the stream and the time duration of the segments on which they can base their choice Starting from the demo application I have tried to implement a new TrackSelection and Factory following the example of AdaptiveTrackSelection I am having difficulty getting the required information about the segments to the new TrackSelection implementation At first I tried registering an AdaptiveMediaSourceEventListener on the media sources replacing the EventLogger in the demo app which the TrackSelection could then grab the data from This works but the data arrives at the AdaptiveMediaSourceEventListener too slowly and so sometimes the TrackSelection is reusing information from the last segment when it is called Then I found this issue where it says that AdaptiveMediaSourceEventListener is only intended for logging not for changing the behaviour of the player which makes sense I possibly should have realised this when I was told about the playback thread versus the background thread sorry about that I can see that the information I'm looking for is available inside DefaultDashChunkSource getNextChunk as the previous parameter as well as in ChunkSampleStream but I'm unsure how to get it from there to my TrackSelection Could I get some advice for how I should aim to go about this Will I have to reimplement DashChunkSource as well as TrackSelection Thanks for all the help so far,,,2017-07-12 16:13:17,2017-07-19 15:26:21

IS,Render Audio normally but Video to ByteBuffer only,Hi it seems like this should be easier than rendering the video output to a surface but I have not figured it out yet What I would really like is to render the video directly to an OpenGLES texture and have the Audio output handled by ExoPlayer This would be equivalent to using the AVPlayer class on iOS mac OS with a custom AVPlayerItemVideoOutput The data stream would look like this Video File URL ExoPlayer Audio playback decoded video in pixel ByteBuffer And I do not think StackOverflow is the place for this question although there are numerous unanswered questions on there along these lines Instead it is about a missing part of the ExoPlayer docs IMHO If there is no currently encouraged possible way of doing this would you kindly point me to what I would need to subclass to get that result,,andrewlewis,2017-07-26 17:00:42,2017-07-27 12:35:22

IS,Selecting multiple video tracks for a video renderer,Hi I know that DASH SRD support is not provided and not planned thus i'm currently trying to implement it in a decent way into exoplayer 2 The purpose of the implementation is to be able to playback a tiled video described with DASH SRD I am currently struggling to find a proper way to render the video I would like to avoid instantiating one renderer per tile because each of them will in turn instantiate a codec and things might get messy as stated in other issues 273 for exemple for limitations on having too many codec instances The plan is to use a single renderer which is fed with several video tracks one per tile and manages the decoding and construction of the final frame I would like to know if you have any advice on how to handle the selection of multiple video tracks for one renderer My guess is by implementing my own version of a TrackSelector which would select one track for each TrackGroup of type TRACK TYPE VIDEO but that means returning more tracks than the number of active renderers several tracks are returned for only one video renderer which does not seem to be the expected behavior of the track selector Should I then grow the list of active renderers by adding my video renderers as many times as there are tiles in the video to make it comply with the framework expectations I would really appreciate to have your thoughts and some advice on the subjects Thanks,,ojw28,2017-04-07 12:11:54,2017-08-04 23:16:51

IS,getCurrentPosition after seekTo accuracy problem,Hi We are trying to develop a Karaoke app We already developed a version on iOS with AVPlayer and everything works great but on Android we have an issue we cannot solve for a long time App consists of animation layer JS WebView animation and music Animation is embedded in WebView and it has method update songCurrentTime which has to be invoked periodically to synchronize animation with song We use Handler and runOnUiThread for update loop We update animation with song position getCurrentPosition every 50ms Everything works great in 100 cases when we start playing music Then we can pause play again and it s also ok Then we want to use seek When we want to seek to position that is already buffered everything is ok But when we use seekTo on position that it s not already buffered we encounter a problem After buffering onPlayerStateChanged and playing again animation is not synchronized with music It s usually about 300ms desynchronized Sometimes it s ok but usually it s not When it is desynchronized we can pause play but it remains the same We don t calculate anything after buffering animation handle going back and forward we update it on loop normally so it looks like getCurrentPosition returns wrong time We tried to update animation with calculated time after buffering using System currentTimeMillis but it cannot work because playWhenReady etc is not synchronized method playing probably starts in other thread so we don t have the exact time of player starting playing The strangest thing is that it only happens when buffering is required We thought it may be something with playing and then buffering and playing again But scenario play pause seekTo wait until buffered play results the same It s hard to show this desynchronization in logs those under are for the pause buffer scenario above player pos is player getCurrentPosition in which delay is about 200ms animation is about 200ms before music What s very interesting is that we encountered the same problem on Android s default MediaPlayer that s why we used ExoPlayer Maybe this is some low level api issues or we do something wrong Animation is 100 ok because it works on iOS with buffering etc and also it works on Android without seek or with buffered seek We really don t know what to do now If anyone experienced something similar or have a clue for us we will be very grateful We tested it on many Android devices including Huawei P9 Samsung Galaxy J3 HTC Desire Nexus 5 and few others Regards,,"ojw28,ojw28",2017-09-02 13:37:03,2017-09-04 10:45:07

IS,Different speed of audio playback on different devices,At first thanks a lot for such an amazing and flexible library I'm writing because of an oddity which I do not know how to explain or resolve When I play back audio on my HTC One I noticed that it runs slightly faster than the video with the same audio on my laptop 1s faster after roughly one hour of playback At the start of the playback the audio on the laptop and the phone is perfectly synchronized but as said after one hour of playback there is a quite notable difference Surprisingly I cannot reproduce this on a newer smartphone Galaxy S7 Edge Assuming that Exoplayer runs a bit faster than it should every now and then I tried to fix this behavior by comparing the current position of Exoplayer with the time where it theoretically should be using System currentTimeMillis but surprisingly the difference here was always just a few ms not explaining the audible difference On the Galaxy S7 Edge these occasional adjustments work perfectly fine to keep the measured difference below 5ms and there is no audible difference For me the assumption would be that System currentTimeMillis does not return accurate results on my HTC One runs too fast or too slow as the difference between audio on the smartphone and audio on the laptop is easily noticeable but somehow I can not believe this and I'm looking for any other possible explanation Of course any thoughts or input would be highly appreciated In general it would also be interesting to know if Exoplayer ensures that after 10s of time elapsed it has played back exactly 10s or to understand how to ensure this myself in a more elegant way than comparing values from System currentTimeMillis with getCurrentPosition Thanks a lot in advance,,"ojw28,ojw28",2017-09-01 05:59:25,2017-09-05 20:09:59
