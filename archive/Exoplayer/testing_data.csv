IS,Support Renderers that do not consume tracks,Previously with ExoPlayer 1 we were using two custom Renderers One for showing debug information overlaid on top of the surface and another one to periodically report back to a listener when 15s of media was played Both of them well at least the latter not really a Renderer per se but it felt pretty clean we did not need to periodically poll the position and we did not need to manage any additional threads With ExoPlayer 2 we run into some difficulties trying to maintain this approach There are no Formats in the MediaPeriod associated with these Renderers so they are not returned by DefaultTrackSelector I suppose we could implement our own DefaultTrackSelector and return these two Renderers when needed but this leads me to the question whether or not this is a bad approach Sure we could go the same approach as DebugTextViewHelper for our first use case even though I prefer to view it as a Renderer and handle it accordingly But what about the other use case of reporting back whenever roughly 15s of media has been played What would be your recommended way of dealing with that Thoughts and comments much appreciated,,"pakerfeldt,ojw28,pakerfeldt,ojw28,pakerfeldt,ojw28,pakerfeldt,ojw28,ojw28",2017-08-28 09:41:19,2017-09-18 11:03:02

IS,Fix adaptive switching for live playbacks close to the live edge,Problem description This is mainly a question about ExoPlayer is behavior and maybe a request for best practices in handling this case In our app we have both normal live streams Live stream with limited availability and what we are calling startover streams which enable you to watch the current program from the beginning Live stream with indefinite availability All are streamed with HLS version 3 Now with live streams we are experiencing the following problem The chunk size on our streaming server was recently reduced to 4 seconds ExoPlayer by default starts playback 3 chunks from the end of the the live window ExoPlayer by default needs a buffer of 10 seconds before switching up at all As a consequence in more than half the trials ExoPlayer is starting playback too close to the live edge It is then never able to reach a buffer size of 10 seconds and will therefore never switch up We are fixing this now by explicitly setting an initial seek position to seconds 90 of the 120 second live window For the startover streams however since we want to allow seeking within the whole available portion of the stream we need to make sure we are not getting too close to the live edge or else the above problem would arise again Hardcoding a margin of 30 or maybe 20 or 15 seconds at the end of the stream i e allow seeking only up to player getDuration 30 000 would probably work but does not seem ideal given that it actually depends on things like chunk size etc Is there a better way to determine the maximum allowed seek position in streams that are still growing at the end Version of ExoPlayer being used 2 4 2 Device s and version s of Android being used FireTV multiple hardware versions,,"ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28",2017-07-03 12:37:30,2017-09-26 19:27:36

IS,Assertion error in SampleMetadataQueue,Issue description This is unfortunately the kind of issues I do not enjoy creating since it is hard for me to gather relevant information but I will do my best During a test session after migrating from ExoPlayer v1 to v2 we noticed one single occurrence of failing assertion here L118 The issue seemed to have happened after a failing load request and even though we tried with broken videos we have been unable to re produce this issue Now when this is being rolled out to a bigger audience I do see more of these failing assertions in Fabric which worries me a bit It should be noted that we are not using the dash component Instead we have our own implementations of MediaSource and ChunkSource with friends and I'm open to the possibility of having some bug in our code However I'm not sure where or how to further troubleshoot the issue Unless you would immediately have an idea of what the root cause might be maybe some elaboration around how discardUpstreamSamples works and why discardCount might end up being invalid to work our way backwards Reproduction steps Unfortunately we have not yet found any re pro steps Link to test content None Version of ExoPlayer being used exoplayer core r2 5 3 exoplayer okhttp r2 5 3 Device s and version s of Android being used From what I can see this issue spans between at least android versions 4 4 4 and 7 1 on various devices including Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and Nexus 6 A full bug report captured from the device Here is a stack trace,,"pakerfeldt,ojw28,ojw28,pakerfeldt,pakerfeldt,ojw28,ojw28,pakerfeldt,ojw28,pakerfeldt",2017-11-08 13:20:16,2017-11-09 13:22:37

IS,Fullscreen dedicated Activity,Issue description When implementing a video component for my application I wanted to include the fullscreen functionality However I have been facing some issues and wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction Here is what I have tried Like many articles I found on the matter I tried adding the view to the root of the layout and make any other elements invisible or even adding it to a fullscreen Dialog The limitation here it would make it difficult to have a substantially different layout on fullscreen and to use the Picture in picture mode Therefore the most suitable solution seems to be a fullscreen dedicated Activity I could just pass the MediaSource and the current position when opening such Activity but it ends up buffering and taking a lot of time to really start the video on fullscreen I also tried to pass the SimpleExoPlayer to the Activity by binding it to a singleton and although it is functionally acceptable I'm not totally comfortable with the implementation The specific question here is is there any way I could pass the current state of the player to the fullscreen Activity in order for it to start from the desired position without the overhead of the initial loading Thanks for your help Version of ExoPlayer being used 2 5 1,,ojw28,2017-11-11 12:20:01,2017-11-13 09:22:09

IS,CEA608 Padding might get into negative ranges,The following line calculates the end padding of the Cue for positioning L727 The values are int endPadding 32 padding StringLength In unexpected cases mostly caused by improper content StringLength might be bigger than 32 The problem is that some content specifically beginnings of commercials in live channels are missing the Preamble Address Code for the very first line setting up the position where the line starts So the first two lines are handled as one incoming characters for both are added into a single StringBuilder and will end up as a single Cue of possibly longer than 32 characters This line does not restrict the range might result in a padding being negative if the character count is bigger than 32 Negative values will cause the SubtitlePainter have invalid ranges and will position the Subtitle completely incorrectly This is caused by incorrect content but happens quite frequently Could we add a simple check for negative values to correct this Something like endPadding Math max endPadding 0 This would correct the calculations so all interim values will stay in the valid range This does not fix the issue the originally 2 lines of subtitles will be shown in a single line but at least inside the visible screen area,,"ojw28,ojw28",2017-12-02 00:17:54,2017-12-12 19:38:10

IS,Explanation of stopInternal call on IO Exception,Hello I am trying to improve the playback buffer behavior when streaming an AAC audio file webradio I am using a CustomLoadControl which works as expected triggers loading below 20 seconds until buffer reaches 30 seconds Now there is a case where the player behaves in an unexpected way but the source code tells me it is intended behavior maybe somebody can clarify the motivation and give me a hint on how to solve this As long as the LoadControl tells the player that it does NOT need to continue loading the playback keeps running depleting the buffer which is fine even if I enter airplane mode which is what I would expect Now the buffer falls under the lower threshold 20 seconds and the LoadControl tells the player to start loading which will cause an IO Exception within the DataSource So far so good Now this IO Exception triggers a call to stopInternal you can see it in the source of ExoPlayerImplInternal around line 350 This will cause the player to stop immediately audio playback instead of continue to play the buffered 20 seconds still available What is the motivation for this and which approach would be most in line with the overall architecture My ideas are Catch IO within my datasource and retry but this seems to circumvent already existing retry options Check in loadControl if network is connected feels wrong the data source should try by itself Hacking around in the ExoPlayerImplInternal feels even more wrong Any magic you come up with Thanks for your feedback Chris,,ojw28,2017-12-12 10:16:29,2017-12-13 09:59:27

IS,DynamicConcatenatingMediaSource with non reusable URLs,I'm using DynamicConcatenatingMediaSource I'm loading a playlist from SQL and adding all the URLs expired or not to the player The problem is My URL which contains the file expire 4 hours after the request I need a way to check before the player loads each MediaSource if the MediaSource is URL is expired or not and if so the player should stop the media source loading and request a new URL for the file from the server Important The solution of checking if the URL expired when I am getting them from the database and request for a new URL if the current is expired is not good because the request takes in average 1 3 seconds the request time is not depends on me So let is say I have 50 songs to request for a new link it will take more than a minute to get all the new URLs and in the meanwhile the playlist is blocked semi blocked,,"tonihei,tonihei",2018-01-03 17:51:23,2018-01-04 10:44:27

container a EXOPlayer instance and play the one which is center in the view display and other EXOPlayer attach in the view will be release They are all m3u8 use HLSMediaSource But we found that its probability when I start to play a video it suddenly can not play and throw the exception and after that all the player can not play with the same exception every EXOPlayer is been wouldead' they are not the same url 2 By the way about this bug i often play the same video same url in other pager such as i play url A in list view and i go another view to play url A and pause the previous player with url A 3 And if I finish the application and restart the app it will be everything ok but i think this is a bad experience can you provide me some useful information about this bug 4 I give two log type below every log have no relevance they occur at different devices but when the EXOPlayer is wouldead' they will throw the same exception such as one of these exception Thanks Log 1 E

IS,ExoPlayer saving cached data of continuous streams inside the app,Dear Sirs I have come across an issue with my app that uses ExoPlayer 2 5 4 to play various streams and I can not seem to find the reason behind it since it does not involve any logs or crashes to track I will try my best to explain it so hopefully you will get the idea In my app I am switching various online streams bu releasing ExoPlayer instance each time I need to start another stream TS and I noticed with higher bitrate streams that after switching to another stream after running the app for the first time the app starts to intensively cache some kind of data on local device storage monitored by dumpsys diskstats and it cache this data until it fills all the available storage on device After the storage is filled Android shows an alert the the device storage is low and apps will stop working but at the same time the stream just keeps on playing and the cache is cleared The interesting thing is that the data is not cached on first instantiation of the ExoPlayer I included the adb log after I am switching the stream and the following reduction in available space on device from dumpsys I tried to reproduce this issue in Demo app but I could not since the Demo app closes the video activity each time I am switching the stream Also I tried including several heavy streams using ConcatinatingMediaSource but there was no data caching happening I also tried to limit the channel switching to player prepare uri without releasing ExoPlayer but the issue still persisted on first channel switch I also tried changing buffer segment size etc One more thing I observed is that this issue happens on Android 6 Android 7 and Android 8 but it does not happen of Amazon FireTV devices it just never starts to cache data I also played with various settings in AndroidManifest I hope you could at least suggest a place I could look into and try since I am out of ideas after a couple of weeks Thanks Link to test content I mostly used internal 4K TS content Version of ExoPlayer being used ExoPlayer 2 5 4 Device s and version s of Android being used Nexus Player Xiaomi Mi Box nVidia SHIELD Fire TVs Fire TV Sticks A full bug report captured from the device,,"ojw28,ojw28,ojw28,ojw28",2018-01-11 18:28:02,2018-01-12 12:08:04

IS,Question about reuse same SimpleExoPlayer instance for different MediaSource,ignored all issue creation suggestion this is a question Hope the title tells the background The detail is In order to create a SimpleExoPlayer instance I must provide a TrackSelector in this case a DefaultTrackSelector which in turn built on a DefaultBandwidthMeter calling this is Meter1 here it is a BandwidthMeter to support adaptive track selection In order to build new MediaSource from Uri taken from intent or online stream I need a DataSourceFactory in this case a DefaultDataSourceFactory and this also built on a DefaultBandwidthMeter Meter2 also here it is a TransferListener The questions are Should Meter1 and Meter2 be the same instance As I suppose that it should use the information provided by TransferListener is functionality in DataSourceFactory for the Track selection judgement in DefaultTrackSelector When I want to reuse that SimpleExoPlayer instance for different MediaSource should I reuse the DataSourceFactory above to create other MediaSource I'm afraid that reusing it and in turn the DefaultBandwidthMeter will cause the confusing between Track selection because DefaultBandwidthMeter is not stateless and an update on the load of an MediaSource using it may effect the track selection of another MediaSource also using it Thanks in advance Also an example showing how to re use the ExoPlayer instance across MediaSource as well as configuration DrmSessionManager extension mode etc is highly expected,,"eneim,ojw28",2018-01-15 04:15:30,2018-01-15 09:02:32

IS,Playing encrypted media with prefixed IV,First many thanks to for sharing his research and results about offlining video with encryption 2467 We are in the same boat as he was wanting to put encrypted media on a phone and then play the files in decrypted streams using a media player such as ExoPlayer His insights such as NoPadding and the sample code for EncryptedFileDataSource probably made it possible for me to get it working when it very well might not have been possible otherwise One thing I would share with others from my experience In the encrypted files that we need to play the IV is prefixed as the first 8 bytes So in order for EncryptedFileDataSource to work I had to introduce an offset In the constructor I added an offset parameter and in setupInputStream I added an instruction to skip over that many bytes So this is not really a request for a fix or a feature and I assume this issue will be closed soon I just wanted to put this out there to acknowledge my debt to and post my small contribution where it might help somebody I would have added this as a comment on 2467 if it were open,,AquilesCanta,2018-02-08 02:10:53,2018-02-08 10:09:09

IS,AudioTrack getTimeStamp API usage in Exoplayer,Issue description Usage of the AudioTrack getTimestamp API is not as per the Android AudioTrack API documentation Reproduction steps When using ExoPlayer demo app add debug log in updateTimestamp from the class AudioTrackUtilV19 Link to API documentation Below link is for your reference getTimestamp android media AudioTimestamp Version of ExoPlayer being used 2 4 0 Detailed description about the query As per the Android AudioTrack API documentation getTimestamp added in API level 19 boolean getTimestamp AudioTimestamp timestamp Poll for a timestamp on demand If you need to track timestamps during initial warmup or after a routing or mode change you should request a new timestamp periodically until the reported timestamps show that the frame position is advancing or until it becomes clear that timestamps are unavailable for this route After the clock is advancing at a stable rate query for a new timestamp approximately once every 10 seconds to once per minute Calling this method more often is inefficient It is also counter productive to call this method more often than recommended because the short term differences between successive timestamp reports are not meaningful If you need a high resolution mapping between frame position and presentation time consider implementing that at application level based on low resolution timestamps The audio data at the returned position may either already have been presented or may have not yet been presented but is committed to be presented It is not possible to request the time corresponding to a particular position or to request the fractional position corresponding to a particular time If you need such features consider implementing them at application level The question is with regard to updateTimeStamp implementation in ExoPlayer why is the AudioTrack API getTimeStamp called at every 500ms Can you please explain the reasons for the same Usage of the getTimeStamp can be found in AudioTrack class where a constant named MIN TIMESTAMP SAMPLE INTERVAL US which is set to 500000 it is this threshold expiry upon which updateTimeStamp gets called,,"ojw28,ojw28",2018-02-12 06:42:28,2018-02-12 10:33:07

IS,No config update for Formatter in DefaultTimeBar when config change,This is rather a question than a issue report although if this is unexpected it should be an issue As I see in the implementation of DefaultTimeBar there is a Formatter in used it is final and initialized with default Locale The concern is when application is config change this formatter is not updated in fact as it is a final member it will not be re initialized on such event I know creating one instance of this is expensive The questions problems ares Latest Android version uses LocaleList getDefault from Android 24 instead of Locale getDefault for modern devices Should ExoPlayer follows this with a fallback for older API I see the formatter is used to update the content descriptions only not impact the visual result But as the concern should the formatter also be updated following the application is config change in View class there is onConfigurationChanged for this purpose and a usage reference can be found in TextView implementation If the problems above are taken into account and implemented by intent it is fine D Otherwise I'm open for a PR,,"eneim,erdemguven,ojw28",2018-02-26 01:20:47,2018-02-26 13:40:53

IS,Improve customisability of PlayerView,I really appreciate we now have a non final PlayerView class for subclassing However I would love to see a minor improvement At the moment subclasses are unable to override behaviour that occurs in reaction to player listener events because the PlayerView does not directly implement those listeners but only via a private inner class ComponentListener This means subclasses cannot simply eg override onPlayerStateChanged I suggest to change that by removing the ComponentListener class and changing the PlayerView itself to implement the listeners currently implemented by ComponentListener I know this is going to remove the comfort of using the DefaultEventListener as a base so there would be a few empty methods but I would not consider that a big issue I'm willing to submit a pull request but wanted to hear your opinion first,,"ojw28,ojw28",2018-03-03 17:13:51,2018-03-05 11:19:02

IS,Forcing DASH HttpDataSourceException Timeout values not working as expected,I am using Exoplayer to stream DASH content I am creating a scenario where the sever becomes unavailable mid play so the app can react When building the HTTP media source DefaultHttpDataSourceFactory I set the connectTimeoutMillis to 5000 Expecting this to be a 5 second TCP timeout I shut the server down whilst exoplayer is playing its buffered track then seek forward way ahead of the buffer prompting Exoplayer to retrieve new chunks from the now unavailable server As expected I receive a HttpDataSourceException Unable to connect to The problem is a setting of 5000 takes 23 seconds to throw the exception not 5 seconds I tried other settings and received unexpected pattern of results Nokia 6 7 1 2 40 000 2m 8s connectTimeoutMillis 40000 timeout exception takes 2m 8s to appear 20 000 1M 23S 10 000 0M 43S 5 000 0m 23S 1 000 0M 7 5S 250 0m 5s 100 0M 4S AVD QVGA 4 4 Not as reliable as a physical device but appears to always be 10x the value 5 000 50 Seconds 3 000 30 seconds etc Other parts of my app use http file download okhttp and the timeout happens to the second of the connect timeout value I set as expected but Exoplayer seems very different Is this by design or should this not be happening Thanks for your help in advance,,AquilesCanta,2018-03-19 23:25:31,2018-03-21 10:56:29
