IS,Tooltips on actionable controls problems with links and in general touch devices,Currently tooltips have a series of issues if added to a link it seems that the tooltip swallows any further attempt to actually trigger the link even when using a mouse or keyboard using a touchscreen conceptually the tooltip is triggered when the trigger element receives focus however if on an interactive element like a button and link but that is currently broken in all cases as per the above point tapping the trigger will already trigger whatever action is associated with it taking the buttons with tooltips as example tapping a button will trigger whatever the click behavior associated with it is and only then show the tooltip Ideally the way tooltips on interactive controls should work for mouse keyboard show the tooltips on focus hover but then do not prevent the default action not dug into the code but likely a preventDefault somewhere is the culprit for touchscreen stylus interactions keep track of whether or not the tooltip is visible if not on first tap focus show tooltip then preventDefault if tooltip IS visible do not preventDefault and allow the control to just carry out its normal function and possibly close the tooltip this way interactive controls with tooltip get a two step process first tap to show tooltip second tap to actually trigger their functionality,,"patrickhlauke,patrickhlauke,patrickhlauke,patrickhlauke,patrickhlauke",2017-07-14 09:09:03,2017-11-11 22:12:22

IS,form groups seem arbitrary and unnecessarily complex,I found myself being confused every time I look something up in the form docs and today I decided to spent some time to figure out why The concept of form group s adds another layer of complexity that is not necessary Using form group seems or is mostly arbitrary The form group class is the easiest way to add some structure to forms Its only purpose is to provide margin bottom around a label and control pairing As a bonus since it s a class you can use it with fieldset s div s or nearly any other element They are used in the majority of form examples in the docs like the more complex layout under Form Rows form row However If you remove the form group from the first row Email Password it does not make a difference If you remove the form group from the second and third row Address Address 2 it just looks broken If you remove the form group from Horizontal Forms horizontal form it just looks broken This example custom styles does not even use them and adding them does not change its style So basically using form group on most forms is mandatory otherwise it just looks like bad styling or even broken When it is not mandatory it does not matter whether you add it or not the form looks the same In other words Adding form group to any form where it is not already present does not change its appearance anyway My suggestion is to remove form group altogether and provide the margin bottom around a label control pair by default as seen in this example custom styles Further control of margin can be achieved using the Spacing Utilities This would de bloat both forms and docs and make them easier to understand conceptually,,"Borkason,mdo",2017-12-19 09:09:19,2017-12-26 21:21:09

IS,Back to CSS prefix,Even after three years that 1235 was locked it still makes sense to add a prefix variable that prefixes all classes OR scopes all classes within the prefix class According to contribution guidelines this is a feature request It is also a duplicate but I could never explain my use case in a locked issue like 1235 I have been using Bootstrap since its beggining I updated from v2 to v3 with a very nice smile on my face Last year we started to use it from Less sources compiled with Webpack We changed some variables but not the styles By the end of this year we made a corporate rebranding All the styles were standardized and we started a separate project to customize Bootstrap Less files in order to apply our new brand guidelines However we are in a crisis here Some parts of the website can be updated with the new styles but other can not because it does not makes sense to invest any effort to adapt old features to new styles So we had the brilliant idea to wrap all the old BS styles inside a contextual class oldbs and apply it only to webpages that need to be compatible with the old interface It would be nice if BS had an option to build this prefix or contextual way of framework application Searching across the web we found some people considering this feature for BS3 to BS4 transition And now well we also are considering this for future migration In the end we have ended up with this tutorial for Less It consists of compiling all bootstrap less file and then prefix all the CSS compiled file with another Less Backwards compatibility or even an easier way to make softer transitions is a must have for a mature and globally used framework like Bootstrap Best regards to all,,"mdo,mdo",2017-12-28 19:52:19,2017-12-31 01:52:06

IS,v4 Supporting browser modules,Hello fine folks of Bootstrap today I wanted to discuss the potential of modifying the bootstrap source JS to support browser based imports natively without any third party tools transpilers or the like Preface At the moment all of Bootstraps JS modules are wirtten to support ES6 and export the class definition This issue would require a slight tweak so that they are browser complaint additionally the import from jQuery declaration would need to be removed The upside of this is that code such as import Alert from ' js bootstrap alert js' would now work when using script type 'module' which even though has somewhat limited search modules scope still becomes a useful feature in the future Especially now Chrome has added dynamic imports Changes required The changes are trivial 1 Delete import from 'jquery' from each src module file 2 import Alert from ' alert' becomes import Alert from ' alert js' 3 In your HTML file You can also use dynamic imports using this method too although I have not personally tested this Performance benefits bootstrap min js 2298 lines 14 9kb util js 162 lines 4 2kb unminified 1 7kb minified alert js 193 lines 4 5kb unminified 1 7kb minified Loading only what you need and loading on demand has obvious advantages and is something that is possible today Next steps Since the changes are fairly trivial is it possible to integrate these into the v4 branch I'm happy to PR some documentation changes If it is possible to make this browser module compatible without much effort that would be awesome Heck maybe they can be exported in a browser module friendly format during build time Cheers,,"Johann-S,Johann-S",2018-01-09 16:26:35,2018-01-10 09:01:41

IS,Feature suggest card columns,I read up on the behavior of the card columns which is supposed to provide the kind of masonry look like Pinterest I understand that there is a default behavior that makes the thing load from top to bottom and then from left to right and that this was intended so But I find this extremely terribly horrible for the following reason which I encountered in my own code and which forced me to stop using this option I was loading over 300 cards into the screen with images and texts on each It takes time for the whole thing to load and you can clearly see how the cards are pushed from left to right as the columns are filling up right until the beginning of the right most column The entire content jumps and scrolls and terribly annoyingly moves until then On the other hand if the cards were loaded from left to right first and only then from top to bottom you would only see the first dozen or so items loaded and the rest would fall outside of your screen The prolonged loading time would no longer be in front of you you would not notice any changes due to the time required for loading being too long Not to mention that if you wish to organize something it gets organized from top to bottom while your viewers expect to see it organized from left to right The way card columns works today may be beneficial for some issues though I can not think of a single one but it is definitely terrible for the most common use cases I suggest to create a version of this feature that loads from left to right first and from top to bottom after that,,mdo,2018-02-22 19:20:21,2018-02-24 19:50:52

IS,Support for server side validation for form grouping constructs,This issue is based on comment issuecomment 322407624 the discussion in 25050 and finally comment issuecomment 353690247 It is a followup of PR 25050 because the discussion became a feature request and went out of scope of the PR content Situation A group of radio buttons or checkboxes For the application logic a certain requirement is posed on the group of inputs but not on the individual inputs For example checkboxes at least one checkbox must be checked or the checkboxes must satisfy a certain relation Usually if radio buttons or checkboxes are grouped they are placed either in a fieldset or div which may have additional styling for a better UX This also helps users with a screen reader a lot Once the form is submitted it is validated That may be server side or a client side JS library Either way often a class is added to the top level where the validation has occurred For a normal text input this is the input For the groups of radio buttons or checkboxes this is the fieldset or div It does not make sense to add the validity class to each child input element because the validity state does not depend on the input itself but rather on the group Problem At the moment there is no support for adding either the is valid or the is invalid class the top level validation element without marking it as a form control which is not correct a wrapper is not an actual thing you can control The labels of the checkboxes and or radio buttons are not colored as invalid Example Bootstrap 3 markup generated with a Symfony form which achieves the required effect The image below is a comparison between BS 3 and BS 4 beta 2 With the workaround 1 With the form control removed No validation errors are visible 2,,mdo,2017-12-23 10:33:47,2018-03-08 11:44:02
