PR,Add SCSS configuration for Hound,What This change uses Bootstrap is existing scss scss lint yml file to configure Hound is hosted SCSS Lint instance It leaves existing JavaScript linting as is because Hound does not support ESLint or JSCS yet It does support JSHint for the master branch but I decided to focus just on v4 for this change How it works On each pull request to Bootstrap Hound will comment on any SCSS style violations in line like this screenshot If you update the pull request to adopt a suggestion the comment will be hidden The same checks are maintained on pull requests Instead of output such as this in Travis it will be an in line comment from Hound Hound is free for open source projects and is open source itself like Travis Why The advantages for the Bootstrap project might be Ruby does not need to be installed on developer is machines in order for grunt test to run all lint checks If jekyll docs could be removed from the build Ruby would not need to be installed on TravisCI Hound runs in parallel to Travis speeding up the time CI finishes by about 4 6s on builds such as For parity with your current setup I have set the fail on violations true setting but if SCSS Lint has false positives or false negatives you can change the setting to false to treat its comments more as suggestions than a binary outcome that should fail the build configuration,,"cvrebert,mdo,cvrebert,cvrebert,cvrebert,cvrebert,cvrebert",2015-10-04 00:26:36,2015-10-04 17:58:03

PR,Multiple button addons in input groups,Let me start by saying that I am not sure if this qualifies as a bug fix or a feature request but I feel like it is more a feature request hence I am opening this against the v4 dev branch I can make this work for master too if you like Changes I made as screenshots because images say more than a 1000 words and all that Before before before focus After after after focus after dropdown 1 after dropdown 2 Aim of change In an input group it is now possible to add multiple button addons after the input with dropdown menus These have to be placed in separate input group btn elements because otherwise the JavaScript breaks Focus state now highlights the complete group of controls too instead of only the input Note that the highlighting only works if the input is the first element in the input group because of CSS limitations I want focus within focus within pseudo Usecase In a project I implemented this for I have a search box where the user can change a couple of settings for the search There are three settings that are all of the type iselect from a couple of options' My approach that I feel is intuitive correct me if I'm wrong was to add three dropdown selects as addons When that was not styled the way I expected it to be I first tried to find out what I was doing wrong then whipped up this then improved it before creating this pull request Remarks I am aware of the following issues The highlighting does not work when there are addons before the input I purposefully disabled the highlighting of other controls then because I am unable to select the siblings before the focus ed input with pure CSS An implementation using JS is of course possible but I think that that is not something you guys would be happy with right This can be fixed once if the CSS4 focus within focus within pseudo selector is supported The left border of buttons is not visible when hovering them The current implementation has exactly this issue but for right borders As soon as a button is focused or active the border becomes visible The current implementation will still not show the right border when the button is focused or active Finally I feel that this pull request has an added value because it gets rid of a margin left 1px hack This is in place currently to get rid of double borders I fix this by removing the left border of elements and adding it back on focus and active only At that point the z index is increased as well as in the current implementation Side note are you considering to introduce variables for the border width as well or will that remain hard coded to a single pixel How can I test this I extended the Bootstrap documentation examples and used those for testing Link to development server 9001 components input group button addons for your convenience current documentation button addons To conclude It goes without saying that I am open to any and all suggestions critique and feedback I can update this pull request as required Thanks in advance for considering this change,,"cvrebert,mdo,cvrebert,cvrebert,cvrebert,patrickhlauke,cvrebert,patrickhlauke,mdo",2015-12-03 13:09:03,2015-12-07 00:35:34

PR,Add dropdown classes for contextual background colors,The Dropdown Element should have the ability to receive colored backgrounds similar to the Table contextual classes contextual classes or card background variants background variants Example Code See docs components dropdowns md Changes There are three special cases I see for the background colors that make the whole change more complex that I like Edge case 1 colored item as first last child this the easiest and cleanest to solve Edge case 2 a divider then a colored item this is annoying since there is now previous sibling in css yet so I worked around it with negative margins and border To keep the margins in sync they are extracted in a variable Edge case 3 a colored item then a divider the is also annoying since the divider is not build in a way that would make this color change easy so I worked around it with a before element A cleaner way might be to find a way to refactor the divider to behave like three stacked color bars on top of each other maybe by just switching the spacing from margins to borders To solve edge case 3 I change the dropdown divider overflow and position behavior Also I removed re integrated mixins nav divider since it was only used by the divider anyways The colors for the dropdown modifier are added to the variables and re use the form state colors as a default The dropdown documentation is extend i a very basic way Questions Does the whole thing compile I do not have a full setup here See comments below Should it also work for the whole dropdown menu like it does for table tr as well as table td Should the docs for Buttons dropdown and Dropdown interlink more Right now they duplicate information but there are no links for the information that is missing in the other place Should there be an inverted case For the docs What is the proper pattern to name the headlines that handle color changes For tables cards they all use different headlines like Contextual variations contextual variations Examples examples Contextual classes contextual classes and so on Maybe I should extract this in a separate issue How to handle the fact that introduces colored hover states that will cause new edge cases for this idea Worst case is that the colors are very similar so the hover effect is nullified,,"cvrebert,cvrebert,cvrebert,cvrebert,cvrebert,cvrebert,cvrebert,mdo",2016-04-24 07:04:13,2016-05-09 16:53:47

PR,v4 Figuring out split dropdown buttons,Fixes 18790 and changes up 17135 This is kinda rough and I'm not super stoked on it but it is the best idea I have had thus far I think Here is what is going on to address the split dropdown button spacing with regards to the caret Added a new functions file to house our strip unit function In the future this could house a rem calc function if we wanted one Note that functions need to be before the variables so that we can use them within the variables file Adds new classes and variables to address the horizontal spacing within split dropdown toggle buttons This is kinda shit but it is explicit and is a single class to add That is better at least than using parents and weirdly rules that are specific to markup Update the examples to include these new classes as well as some sizing examples for the split dropdown buttons since we were lacking those anyway Still noodling and open to more ideas if folks have them,,"mdo,mdo",2016-01-08 21:30:40,2016-05-11 22:03:51

PR,Strip out UMD CJS in favor of ES6 modules,Step 1 of N in working out a proper modules story for Bootstrap 4 to address 19017 others This removes UMD and CommonJS transpilation from the build Eventually I propose that we offer both and only Native ES6 modules which should be our original source code which import their dependencies To be added via a future PR A pre transpiled all modules in one file ES5 file that exports things as global vars on the window object e g window Tooltip and likewise expects its dependencies to available as globals Why these 2 As I see it Bootstrap is constituents can be broadly classified into 1 Early adopters using ES6 2 Folks using older module formats loaders transpilers such as AMD requirejs CommonJS browserify etc 3 Folks especially those who are not front end experts using script tags globals and self discipline as their JS module system Folks in groups 1 and 2 are already using tools build tools transpilers loaders etc and these tools require a comparatively higher level of technical skill so asking them to configure their tools to ingest ES6 modules is reasonable Especially since ES6 has been standardized by the browser vendors and will in time be supported natively in browsers And for group 1 this should be essentially no extra work whatsoever Trying to accommodate group 2 more from our side is a decent amount of extra work for us to support formats which will be to my knowledge increasingly legacy thus lower priority as adoption of ES6 standard modules progresses and to help a bit folks who generally speaking do not need as much assistance in the first place Group 3 is anecdotally a large segment of our userbase and asking them to start using a build system so that they could use our ES6 code directly does not seem viable In the case of newbies to development in general they would likely need a lot of high touch help which we are not in a position to provide to setup their build systems or at least might encounter lots of frustration while setting it up In the case of others e g backend developers they might have the necessary skill but not be willing to invest the requisite amount of time particularly when they might not be familiar with the toolset Node js npm Sass PostCSS Babel etc and might not value the knowledge gained as much Bootstrap is instant gratification experience just copy 2 files insert 2 HTML tags is highly valuable to this group The all in one ES5 using globals file allows group 3 to continue with their existing simple workflows from Bootstrap v2 v3 undisturbed There is one other group worth noting which is the subsection of groups 2 3 who were using Bootstrap v3 is individual JS files tooltip js etc It is less obvious to what extent we should prioritize this group and what we could should offer them It is also harder to characterize this group Most of our modules now depend on our util js module so they are not as self sufficient as they were in v3 We could offer a build that bundled util js into all the other modules but that results in multiple copies of the util code if the user is using multiple modules Not seeing an obvious best solution here my current proposal is that such users should migrate to either ES6 modules if modularity was their chief concern and they have sufficient technical ability to adopt a build system or to the all in one ES5 using globals file if ease of use was their chief concern at the expense of optimal performance CC team for discussion,,"cvrebert,hnrch02,petetnt,cvrebert,bardiharborow",2016-06-05 03:36:08,2016-06-10 16:28:03

IS,v4 Alpha 6 ship list,Highlights Flexbox is now on by default with no fallback This means we have dropped IE9 support but with significant savings to our code base simpler components and improved customization thanks to the power of flexbox Rebuilt the navbar with flexbox in mind leading to some structural changes but including more flexibility and customization Includes updated docs code snippets more responsive options All navbars in our examples are also using the latest markup and styles now Also solves around 10 bugs in the process Overhauled flexbox utilities and documented them Replaced all the previous flexbox utilities with new ones that are named after property value pairs instead of creating new names for things For example flex items between is now justify content between to apply justify content between This also adds tons of new flexbox utilities for display order wrap and more Revamped navs Sass with flexbox and updated docs All the float s and clearfixs have been removed nav inline removed on account of display flex inlining for us on nav added fill and justify options and more Fixed up all examples to use latest navbar and grid changes Building on the grid improvements from Alpha 5 you can now customize container padding across grid breakpoints and optionally remove grid gutters with no gutters Similarly our flexbox grid system has new classes for automatically sizing columns to the size of their content across viewports e g you can now apply col xs 6 col md auto and col xl 4 to a single element Grid display float margin padding and text utility classes have been significantly overhauled In addition to all classes now being responsive the xs tier no longer requires a breakpoint abbreviation making for shorter and more descriptive classes and an easier migration from v3 For example instead of d xs none it is back to d none while it remains d sm md lg xl none for those breakpoints Renamed some active all in and all open classes for our JavaScript powered components for more consistent naming For example instead it is now collapse show instead of collapse in and show dropdown menu instead of open dropdown menu to better communicate the visibility of elements Refactored carousel with new simpler styles better documentation and less specific selectors Rewrote progress component without the progress element due to lack of animations no support for multiple bars and no support for labels on the progress bars Fixed some unescaped s in our SVG data URLs that are used to add vector background images Renamed tag back to badge like v3 to avoid conflicts with common WordPress styles A number of custom form enhancements and bugfixes were made Label less custom radios and cehckboxes fixed SVG URLs in background image s and more Updated Normalize css to v5 0 0 form check and form check inline now share the same markup Switch between the two by adding or removing form check inline as a modifier Added support for

IS,Responsive grid system for component development,Quick summary Media queries do not work for component development we need another solution We are using Bootstrap in our efforts to build a component widget library This works very well but we are running into issues when it comes to more complex responsive components When building a component we do not know in which context the component will be used later Especially regarding the size of the parent container where it will be embedded in the target application The following picture tries to explain the issue Component A is used in two containers which have a different width Component A wants to react to the different container sizes and display itself according to the available space But this is not possible with the Bootstrap grid system because it relies on media queries which always target the whole screen or iframe and not the size of the container That means e g the same col classes will be active for the small and the large version of Component A at the same time making it impossible to show a small and a large version of Component A image The main issue lies within the nature of CSS media queries This is a general issue when developing reusable responsive components There are some alternative approaches like Element Queries but it is far from a web standard and has its own drawbacks Therefore we developed a small extension to the existing Bootstrap grid Note that this solution is still based on Bootstrap v3 but it shows the approach and should be easily adaptable for v4 This extension is used activated by simply applying the container class to the parent container so all the grid classes respond to the container size class instead of the media queries of the standard Bootstrap grid This allows to apply the container classes in whichever way makes sense for the application Most likely it will be applied via JavaScript as a result of a window resize event handler The biggest limitation of this solution is that it is not working recursively which could become a problem when components are containing other components I would love to hear your thoughts and get some feedback if possible It would be awesome to get a proper solution for this in Bootstrap v4 as component development will become more and more important,,mdo,2017-01-11 15:59:08,2017-01-16 19:12:36

IS,Toggleable navbar defaults to a collapsed state,I was implementing a navbar toggler and noticed that the docs example toggler recommends including the collapse class alongside navbar collapsed in the source markup This seems to ensure that the toggleable content is hidden from the start and if Bootstrap is javascript files fail to load and or execute that content will still be hidden and unreachable to the user image I noticed that if I remove the collapse class from the starting markup the class will still be applied by JS when the viewport size is small and that is great There is still a relatively minor issue of having a button that does nothing in that case since it requires JS to function but at least the content is all readable Omitting the collapse class from the start seems to be a more resilient approach to recommend in the docs if possible but I admit there may be reasons this is not possible that I'm unaware of As a sidenote I understand that collapsing the content late e g after JS finishes loading is not desirable or acceptable for a smooth fast page render There are probably other ways but we typically work around this situation by applying a top level enhanced class immediately from a script in the head of the page and keying many components' collapsed states off of that class e g enhanced collapse display none knowing that the class may later be removed if the required scripts fail to load in a given amount of time article on that optimistic approach here Thanks for considering the feedback,,mdo,2017-02-27 23:00:37,2017-03-24 05:23:08

PR,Replace dropdown backdrop hack with cleaner JS only hack,As discussed in 22422 the current approach of injecting a backdrop to work around iOS' broken event delegation for the click event has annoying consequences on touch enabled laptop desktop devices Instead of a backdrop div here we simply add extra empty noop mouse listeners to the immediate children of body and remove them when the dropdown is closed in order to force iOS to properly bubble a click resulting from a tap essentially method 2 from This is sufficient except in rare cases where the user does manage to tap on the body itself rather than any child elements of body which is not very likely in an iOS phone tablet scenario for most layouts to get iOS to get a grip and do the correct event bubbling delegation meaning the regular click event will bubble back to the body when tapping outside of the dropdown and the dropdown will close properly just like it already does even without this fix in non iOS touchscreen devices browsers like Chrome Android and Windows on a touch laptop This approach though a bit hacky has no impact on the DOM structure and has no unforeseen side effects on touch enabled laptops desktops nor non iOS mobile tablet devices And crucially it works just fine in iOS tested on iPhone and iPad Additionally this PR removes the styles associated with the now unnecessary dropdown backdrop and updates the documentation possibly in far too much under the hood detail,,"patrickhlauke,Johann-S,patrickhlauke,Johann-S,patrickhlauke,patrickhlauke,Johann-S,patrickhlauke",2017-04-12 20:11:52,2017-04-14 08:19:00

PR,Dropdown tether,ok here is my first go at it i have not done any documentation since it is too early but here are the main points areas of discussion 1 i got rid of dropdown margin top so as to use the offset to more correctly position the dropdown useful for when the dropdown can reposition based on viewport size 2 since the dropdown menu now gets moved out of being a child of dropdown it faciliated the need for some minor css changes most notably open dropdown menu needed to be changed since dropdown menu was no longer a child of dropdown This means that the open class is actually used in two separate elements now the dropdown and the dropdown menu This seems a little wierd to me but I do not know how else to do it we could technically probably get rid of the open on the dropdown element but I left it intact for now partially because there are unit tests around it but also because there is a css class dealing with getting rid of an outline on focus on the dropdown if the dropdown toggle is an a tag 3 instead of just using position and a map like the toolip js does i just exposed the entire attachment targetAttachment variables I felt that more flexibility was better centering a dropdown on the target etc than creating a simplified map Otherwise we could create a map with the four most common bottom left bottom right top left top right 4 i still left dropdown as available to just instantiate by use of a class vs having to instantiate like tooltip with javascript this could be changed but i was not sure what kind of discussions have happened around that etc 5 context menu is available so that the dropdown menu object can always be referenced from the dropdown context no matter where it may move in the DOM This is necessary so that the menu can be found again after it has moved in the DOM I think perhaps it is worth adding data target like the modal so that this can be explicitly set if desired 6 i defaulted the constraints to have the dropdown shift into viewport always but maybe this is not desired to be default i think normally when the dropdown goes out of viewport horizontally users would almost always want expect this however the dropup behavior for when it goes out of viewport vertically may not be desired as default 7 i cleaned out a couple classes but there are still some dropup and navbar fixed bottom styles that can probably be removed throughout the scss this is my first time using some of the bootstrap build tools grunt ruby etc so my apologies if i did anything wacky New options,,"719media,cvrebert,719media,Johann-S,719media,FezVrasta,719media,FezVrasta,719media,719media",2016-04-08 20:40:20,2017-04-22 19:07:09

IS,Alpha version 6 container inside navbar on extra small screens xs does not render 100 width using col 12,Currently on Alpha version 6 you wish to set your nav items in the navbar constrained within your container div similar to what is currently on the Bootstrap 4 site I would find this a common use case scenario Despite you setting a wanting to set a full width column on extra small screens 'xs' using the grid is col 12 class when viewing the page in xs breakpoint screen size it seems like the widths are never ever 100 width and the size of the column would depend on the width of the content and it is 'centered' E g html below which would trigger this issue Under Bootstrap 3 with the above code the behaviour would render the column the correct 100 width and text would start from the left of the page You can see the results of the test here This also shows a comparison with a similar markup structure without the ' navbar' div output I have a feeling it would be due to the flexbox configuration set to display as flex and the container div not explicitly stating that it should be 100 width on xs screens Unless if there was an intention to do things this way I think the way to fix this is that if you set the container width to 100 by default you can avoid any future issues where you wrap the container with a flex boxed div Other issue information as follows Operating system and version MacOS ver 10 12 3 Browser and version Chrome ver 58 0 3029 110 Only tested on the above but I'm pretty sure it will happen on other devices browsers as well Cheers,,mdo,2017-05-25 14:03:04,2017-05-26 03:44:12

IS,Suggestion Form validation Icons should be displayed with a generic class v4 alpha,To display an icon in an input element you have to add has success to the parent element and form control success to the input element like so Source checkboxes and radios It would be great if the icon could be displayed with a generic class that displays an icon according to the parent has class That would be an advantage to template languages where I would not have to check the validation status a second time on the input element but only once on the parent element,,"Borkason,mdo",2017-03-02 09:58:24,2017-06-07 05:51:42
IS,v4 Form validation,I love how easy it is to style forms with bootstrap but I felt that the validation classes could be improved a bit For those of you who want to jump straight to the demo here you go Lets look at the first validation example examples in the docs Currently we would have to do the following steps in javascript to toggle between the different validation states 1 Remove the previous has from the parent element and then apply the new class 2 Remove the previous form control from the input and then apply the new class 3 Overwrite the inner HTML of the form control feedback with the new message I think that we could eliminate step 2 and 3 by making the following changes collapse form control into a single class that changes its background image based upon the has of its parent set form control feedback content to data attributes based upon the has of its parent forms scss This is probably outside the scope of bootstrap but I also wrote some javascript that leverages HTML5 validation attributes to apply the appropriate has I plan on expanding this to include a pattern for has warning but this jsbin gets the general idea across,,mdo,2017-03-15 03:19:28,2017-06-07 05:51:55
IS,form control success is required to display the validation icon,In the documentation it mentions that To use add has warning has danger or has success to the parent element Any col form label form control or custom form element will receive the validation styles But if we only add has success to the form group div the form control success will still need to be manually applied to the input textbox to show the validation icon Have I misunderstand the documentation,,mdo,2017-03-14 06:23:13,2017-06-07 05:52:02

IS,Your CSS is deeply flawed,There are a number of BAD CSS styling issues in Bootstrap that have now become apparent as Ive looked at it in depth Ive been designing cross browser CSS since 2000 15 years and I had assumed your team understood the long history behind good style sheet design Maybe not Please review this small sample of what I see in your codebase 1 Why are FONTS in pixel units That s the number one NO NO in CSS design classes When you lock a font in pixels you automatically prevent scaling in many user agents Users may be able to zoom but thats not the same as users who set font size use custom style sheets or have very very large DPI screen where pixel based units shrink fonts to almost nothing This is the FIRST thing we learned in creating good flexible font sized HTML structuring as well 2 Why are FONTS not in EM units so users with zoom or text resizing enabled users can see larger fonts automatically when scaling Instead you are using pixels or percentages which again are not consistently interpreted by various user agents when zooming This locks fonts in with unreliable zoom controls that are vastly different in different displays 3 Why are PRINT style sheets not available and designed with FONTS in points There are hundreds of printer types and most wont know what a pixel font size means Interpretation is vastly different between them POINTS is how printers normally process print style sheets Without a print sheet in your CSS your pages are basically a MESS and unprintable as well Your CSS structures and div is should also be designed around FONT SIZE like EM anyway so when you create a print CSS sheet you simple override the FONT SIZE for the page in points in one place Your whole page can then be zoomed in print preview Did no one on your team understand printing in CSS and how to design web pages that are also printable 4 Why are you setting block level elements in pixels Another NO NO in CSS as you dont know what zoom or DPI a given device is at Again you should be setting width and height in either auto percentages or tied to the font size settings em units so the web page grows like a balloon to match screens sizes and zoom settings Older people often have made changes to fonts in iPhone or web browsers which then require all the font AND the div is resize with the font size by hard coding in pixels youve locked down everyone to rigid sizing so future devices now wont look good By using EM units for relative font sizing people on really large screens for example where there are many pixels per inch suddenly get the EXACT same layout and increased margins as say an iPad or tablet 5 Why are you setting margins on div s that can have 100 width NEVER set margin on any structure unless its outer parent has auto width Doing margins on HTML structures forces the design to break out of the parent overflow or worse hide content if the parent has say 100 width or borders Ive seen all your forms and controls now overflow parents because if this Again you are adding stuff you dont need If you STRIP AWAY all that CSS the browser naturally fits all those structures into the web page without any styling Add all that stuff just destroys the natural display of the native user agent content layout Its pretty bad when a web page with NO CSS looks better on multiple devices than one with stacks of CSS added 6 Why is Bootstrap using so many floats When you use floats you break out if the content flow pattern Floats should be used very very cautiously for a few rare structural pieces or images Doing so forces those items to break out of the normal inline flow To recapture that box model you have to add HTML that clears the float CSS is not designed to provide markup to solve that that so your solution managing floats is often incomplete You are then forced to clear all or add dummy breaks so the floats dont rip through parent div s Bootstrap doesnt tell these kiddos that so their content blocks break through the parent and cause scrolling issues in various devices With the margin and pixel issues above your overflow problems are now enhanced Again the box model is not designed to use floats for managing structure That should be on a block level basis This is just the beginning of all the bad CSS I see Im hoping as the web matures we do not keep going back to 2001 to revisit web issues we solved 15 years ago kids today are recreating I think the term is reinventing the wheel lets get some training and move CSS forward not backward as its a huge waste of time to bolt on these API is and frameworks to then find they are using old fashioned solutions developers solved 15 years ago Mitchell,,patrickhlauke,2017-06-16 22:21:07,2017-06-16 23:02:39

IS,custom control margin and padding,Currently custom control uses a sass variable custom control gutter which is default 1 5rem It seems the reason for this additional 0 5 is for creating space between the input custom control indicator and any label text custom control description However when desiring to use a standalone input without a label perhaps for use in a table where the label is in a thead element in a column as an example this additional padding makes things space poorly There are actually two reasons for this the margin applied to the custom control and the padding applied to the custom control The margin comes about because of Now this is not too bad to overcome by just using m 0 class on the custom control However the padding just does not make sense to me why it is that way to begin with Since the custom control description class is already documented why not apply the padding to this element instead There is no reason to create space around the input for purposes of a description unless there is indeed actually a description right So I think that the proper sass for this should be See the following fiddle for an easy to see representation Thoughts,,"719media,719media,mdo",2017-04-17 21:19:28,2017-06-18 04:35:20

IS,Possibly unintended behavior for modal margins,In v4 alpha 6 there is some possibly unintended behavior for modal margins In the current setup modals have margin modal dialog margin by default L45 and switch to margin modal dialog sm up margin y auto above the small media breakpoint L130 However this means that if the small breakpoint is set to be smaller than the max width of the modal then the modal will have no margins In my case I notice this effect with a small breakpoint of 480 the default modal width of 500 and using the modal code from the documentation Under these conditions when the screen width is between 480px the small breakpoint and 500px the max width of the modal the modal has no margins This issue can be worked around fairly easily but it does seem like unintended behavior It might be better if the modal was guaranteed to have nonzero margin at all breakpoints rather than just below the small breakpoint,,mdo,2017-01-24 18:35:52,2017-06-18 05:26:59

PR,JS module transition allow to customize transition duration in sass and custom css,The JS modules using transitions modal alert popover collapse carousel currently emulate the transitionEnd event with a duration defined as a static value in each module If the transitions duration set in css are different than the statics values in each modules TRANSITION DURATION it creates a visual glitch The show class is set after the duration set in each module disregarding the value set in the css transition property For example the collapsing module define a static duration of 600ms If we set in scss transition collapse height 1s ease The 1s transition will be initiated and the collapsible area start expanding After 600ms the function transitionEndEmulator trigger the transitionEnd event even though the transition is not complete yet The collapsing class will be removed from the collapsible area and it will suddenly appear expanded fully without the transition having completed Also if we set in scss transition collapse none a 600ms transition will still be emulated and the show class will be set after 600ms while it should be set right away This PR add the function transitionEmulator to emulate emulate the transition with the duration set in css and to handle the case of no transition or a 0 duration As a result we can change the transition duration of modal alert popover collapse and carousel components with sass variables we can define specific custom classes with different transition duration i e we can have a collapsible area that expand in 350ms and another one in 700ms we can set the transition to none with sass variable 18156 can be solve by setting transition collapse none we do not have a risk to have discrepancy between the js module static duration value and the sass variable that would cause a visual glitch and the static duration in each module are now useless In addition the function transitionEmulator handle more common code that were previously repeated in each module determine if there is a transition to apply previously the presence of a class was checked in each module which was failing to determine a transition set by a custom class Order properly the transition start and the completion callback depending on the presence of a transition or not i e if transition setTimeout to call complete callback then start the transition if no transition start the class change and then call the complete callback without timeout As a result it simply the code related to transition in each module and would make it easier to avoid mistakes in future modifications in each modules Finally the PR updates the unit to test each module behavior with and without transitions,,"pvdlg,pvdlg,Johann-S,bardiharborow,pvdlg,bardiharborow,pvdlg,pvdlg,mdo,mdo",2017-01-07 01:37:17,2017-07-02 06:42:33

IS,Suggestion to remove col form label in horizontal forms in favour of cleaner code and better looking forms,From the documentation Be sure to add col form label to your label s as well so they re vertically centered with their associated form controls While working with forms I stumbled about something that seems overly tedious I experimented with two forms in a JSFiddle and the result is this In Form 1 col form label does indeed vertically position the label in a horizontal form Although this does not apply to larger form controls like textarea What actually happens is that the label is baseline is aligned with its associated form control is baseline of its first line of text But that is just a side note If you are omitting col form label the label aligns at the top of its associated form control making the form look unbalanced or even broken You can see this at Form 2 That practically makes col form label a requirement in horizontal forms So if something is required why not make it the default My suggestion is that class col form label should be removed but it is properties should be the default for any label of horizontal forms In my understanding this can easily be done because any affected label is a direct child of a div with both classes form group and row This change would give all horizontal forms a clean visual look by default and make them easier to understand and quicker to write while removing unnecessary clutter from the code This would also improve the documentation as col form label is mentioned in the form docs 26 times at the time of writing this suggestion grafik,,"Borkason,mdo",2017-07-13 09:53:54,2017-07-14 23:34:53

IS,Communication transparency,Dear Bootstrap Team I can not emphasize more how much I appreciate what you guys are doing here Bootstrap is a fabulous piece of code which let is be honest has dominated it is part of the market I have been using it since v 2 0 2 and felt in love since day 1 However since few months I see some communication gap between and other team members and rest of the world I know that this project is big and it needs time I'm also aware that no one is working in it full time it is side project very extensive though I am pretty sure that everyone understands that this is taking time and even Beta will take another 2 months that is fine However 1 thing which makes me uncomfortable is a lack of any communication Project status was jumping on and of 99 for months Bootstrap slack also does not help I have seen many questions about some deadlines but they never got a clear answer I have been browsing lot I even started following you guys on twitter and got excited every time when you posted anything regarding Beta But from what I can see there are more and more people getting frustrated about the fact that there are no clear guidance nor roadmaps I see that I am not the only with this feeling I know that the best thing we could do is to contribute and believe me along with my team we committed multiple PRs however since few weeks although we would like to help we have a feeling that there is not much we can do I am only getting suggestions to work on other issues but without clear roadmap my team and I we are losing motivation and hope that Beta will be ever released What I would like to hear from is either We want to release BETA in 2 weeks time this list of open issues which have to be fixed we have to configure new servers CDN docs and few other administrative tasks You can help with point 1 and 2 the rest is mine or There are too many new issues showing that current version is not stable so we will not release BETA until September or later Anything would be better than an answer like Beta will be ready when it will be ready,,bardiharborow,2017-07-19 07:43:37,2017-07-19 09:40:43

IS,support bg faded as progressbar background for indeterminate like state,I saw a bug was rejected regarding implementing an indeterminate state for the progress bar But I was thinking about a little hack for which it seems that it would cost almost nothing to implement and could enable a pretty good indeterminate like state First the problem that I have is that when you trigger an action in my GUI it takes some time before the progress bar moves from 0 So I would like to show some animation in that time to let the user know that the action was indeed triggered Once the progress is strictly over 0 then I would go back a more normal look And my idea to give this feedback of indeterminate state is with the following CSS style progress bar progress bar striped progress bar animated bg faded So width 100 faded animated With the gray style and full width progress bar I would be a pretty good indeterminate state I think Obviously the issue for me is that bg faded does not exist for the progress bar So the question is do you think it would make sense to add it for that purpose or you see it as a hack and do not want to add it EDIT aha I think I can achieve that myself by overriding the background color to lightgray or something of the sort Well maybe this could still be already out of the box in bootstrap,,mdo,2017-07-20 16:14:10,2017-07-21 02:49:12

IS,Remove jquery from required packages,Relates to 22194 jQuery should be removed from the mandatory dependencies for Bootstrap library Since Bootstrap is posioned as CSS framework not JS one and it is declared it can function without JQuery even while it is limiting its features there should be a way to install pure Bootstrap without JQuery from the repositories like Bower Npm In particular these lines should be removed L34 L35 In the modern web application development more and more projects relies on suhc JS libraries like AngularJS ReactJs EmberJS and so on in pursuit for 'on page site' feature implementation If particular developer wishes to use AngularJS and Bootstrap why should he install a 'jquery' package which will lie as a garbage among the project source files Keeping 'jquery' as mandatory dependency looks unprofessional Ideally JS related code should be moved into a separated repository which will depend on 'twbs bootstrap' and 'jquery' while 'twbs bootstrap' itself will be requirement free If this be a Composer installation the quick solution will be move 'jquery' into suggest suggest section but for Bower Npm I can not say,,"mdo,mdo,Johann-S,bardiharborow,XhmikosR,Johann-S,bardiharborow,Johann-S,XhmikosR,mdo,mdo,Johann-S,XhmikosR,Johann-S,mdo",2017-08-02 12:36:14,2017-08-09 15:32:18

IS,progress bar When adding labels to non default height bars text displays at the top of the bar,Apologies if this is a duplicate or intentional I searched but was not able to find any matches In the latest bootstrap 4 alpha6 when adding a non default height to a progress bar labels render at the top of the bar For example taking the basic example from labels and adding a height the label shows at the top of the bar I would guess it should be middle screen shot 2017 05 26 at 10 20 39 This could be addressed by adding display flex and align items center to progress bar but that feels a bit weird to me While considering the impacts to other things in these changes I also noticed that when using multiple bars non default heights behave more weirdly screen shot 2017 05 26 at 10 21 26 Using the flex center changes makes it a little better but not by much This all seems like a lot of work headaches so I would like to make a small suggestion change up progress bars so that the height gets set on progress and progress bar just has height 100 With the flexbox changes above this leads to looking like so screen shot 2017 05 26 at 10 33 09 I think this ends up being a bit more flexible and maintainable but I did not want to drop a PR over the wall or come in and say you should do things this way because I do not know any context about why things are the way they are I just know what I see and my uninformed assumptions Hopefully this helps and I will make a PR to detail all the differences just in case,,davethegr8,2017-05-26 17:42:56,2017-08-11 05:52:12

IS,Issues with buttons inside input groups,I realized there is a little bit of a problem with my fix in 22612 The CSS for input group btn uses negative margins to overlap borders so there is only 1 border width between buttons which was fine with a solid border color but now with translucent borders they combine to make a darker border bootstrap input group This could be fixed by removing either the left or right border of buttons inside input group btn s I can submit a PR that does this if this seems like the right way to go However there are a couple other issues I would like to bring up because they can be addressed in the same PR First the current code of input group btn seems to try to support the following HTML structures Unfortunately 2 and 3 are mostly broken right now Should Bootstrap support all three of these structures Finally do you think btn group s should have a translucent border similar to input groups as in all the time even when they are not inside an input group btn The decision on that will affect the code for handling btn groups inside input groups Side note Issue 23006 is related to this,,mdo,2017-08-11 21:56:02,2017-08-18 20:16:09

PR,Made modal dispose work at any point in modal is lifecycle prevented crashes if multiple modals are alive,The current implementation of dispose does not work correctly when any modal is opening open or closing including the one being disposed To fix this modals need to know the state of the currently open modal I have done this by maintaining a global counter which is incremented when a modal starts showing and decrements when it is done hiding or is disposed The counter is stored in 'body' data 'bs modal refcount' I chose this approach because it also prevents the whole page from locking up if multiple modals are alive at once Additionally some events needed to be cleaned up when dispose is called during or immediately after a transition If they are not the backdrop modal open class or resize event can be leaked or prematurely removed It could also crash in several places The events that have to be cleaned up are Transition end handlers Hide show timeouts Focus event Resize event Support for manual removal of modals i e modal modal backdrop remove and body removeClass modal open is retained even if the user is not aware of the refcount because manual removal leads to a state that can never be reached normally This state can be detected and fixed I have added assertions afterEach test to check that there are no modals still alive I have added new tests for dispose and for multiple open modals and I added a test to the visual tests file for more aggressive testing of transitions in combination with dispose I was not sure about a few things I needed the timeout id from emulateTransitionEnd so I made it return it Do you care about backwards compatibility for that method Should disposing a modal add the area hidden attribute In the tests afterEach block should I use assertions or throw If I use assertions I have to change all the asserts expect calls,,"cvrebert,Johann-S",2016-06-16 07:57:17,2017-09-17 07:01:25

IS,New display utilities d sm md lg xl of the beta release break the hidden attribute,We are using Angular 4 for our application and have some markup for our navbar that hides some content based on responsive breakpoints and also by application logic Consider the following example We have a ul element in our navbar that is only visible on medium and up devices The element is also hidden if the user is not logged into our app using the hidden HTML attribute controlled via Angular This logic is required because that part of the navbar holds some contextual user controls like notifications profile image etc On smaller devices we hide it because we use some other markup Using the alpha version the markup was as follows ul class nav navbar nav hidden md down hidden this isLoggedIn This worked just fine because Bootstrap set display none on those breakpoints otherwise the element is display property was controlled using the angular binding to the hidden HTML attribute hidden is Angular syntax After migrating to the beta version of Bootstrap the markup had to be changed to ul class navbar nav d none d md flex hidden this isLoggedIn But this really breaks things First of all now developers are required to explicitly set an element is display property to something to be able to show it on a certain device On the older version we did not need to do this instead the element had it is display property set to its initial value Now if we want to display the element and also retain its initial display value we have to know the default for each element for a div set it to block for a span set it to inline etc I think a d sm md lg xl initial class would help with this issue The other issue is more infuriating d md flex sets the element is display value to flex important This makes the hidden attribute on the element useless We are now facing this issue and came up with a solution but it is not quite pretty We have made an Angular directive to replace the usage of the hidden attribute with this custom functionality that basically set is the element is display property to none important based on a condition using JavaScript code So our markup became this ul class navbar nav d none d md flex rz hide rz hide if this isLoggedIn Internally that rz hide stuff is also Angular syntax that does this under the hood All of this could have been simpler if only Bootstrap did not use the important keyword in it is classes We have struggled for 2 days to find a solution to this because apparently it is not easy to override the important keyword using JavaScript See this stackoverflow post Now I do understand this is necessary but the fact that we had to work around this issue is unpleasant Also I think that it is bad to not use standard functionality for doing this kinds of stuff The hidden attribute was used to do what it was meant to do Now we are using custom attributes which are not only semantically weird but also more verbose I am reporting this as a bug because it did break our code but to conclude I would see this resolved by proposing to move back to the alpha approach to set the display value to none on certain break point to show hide element on different devices instead of explicitly setting it to block or flex etc I think this affects all environments but for the record we are developing under Operating system Windows 10 Browser Chrome 50 Bootstrap version 4 beta,,mdo,2017-09-30 12:30:42,2017-10-01 21:33:45

IS,Add an order class to be before unspecified columns like flex first did previously,Like I mentioned in another issue I love how intuitive the new order classes are However when playing with them tonight I found that there is no way to move a div unless other div s in the row are also specified Since the default flex order is 0 the Bootstrap order classes can only move div s to the right of an unspecified div such as col or col md Previous solution In the alphas we had access to the class flex first which would force the div to be the first column regardless by setting the order to 1 I think the idea of this can be included while still maintaining the simplicity of the order classes Proposed solutions Having a class with the property of order 1 would be one idea Maybe order first order before order 0 or even the former flex first or something completely different just spitballing I would hate to slip down the slope of requesting 12 more order classes for negative numbers but maybe we could introduce one class to force a column first The default order could be changed as well but this would cause the opposite problem Another solution could be to ignore it and just require devs to implement their own class if they want to reorder a column to be before an unspecified Bootstrap column div I want to make sure Bootstrap retains as much functionality as possible to allow these width agnostic columns because it is such a powerful feature that allows for so much elegant flexibility when developing,,mdo,2017-08-14 01:28:29,2017-10-03 01:56:14

IS,Opt in responsive mobile first and state management,I have been using Bootstrap since 2 throughout 3 and have already delivered some using 4 What started out as server generated HTML with jQuery became whole applications using libraries like Angular and React Herein lies my problem with the direction that BS3 took and where 4 is also going Now that it is easier to create re usable components and even manage layouts responsively using JS I find myself fighting the mobile first responsive functionality and state management that is forced upon me via BS4 Some examples of pain points Navigations now require you to use a helper class to automatically collapse navbar expand Cards automatically wrap around as the screen gets smaller Form styling depends on a specific ordering of DOM due to sibling selectors like BS3 had direct child selectors for things like navigations which made it difficult for Angular because you had to do a lot of wrapping for conditionally displaying DOM Now BS4 is enforcing siblings for state management A couple of years ago all of this was excellent because state management and responsive sites required a lot of work and were difficult when the server generated your DOM Nowadays I would just be happy with having a CSS framework that looked great out of the box but allowed me to manage state responsiveness myself What I would like to see Responsive mobile first split away at least different SCSS files so I can choose to not include them State management split away things like display none and sibling selection to display things Would you accept PRs for stuff like this or does it go against where you would like Bootstrap to be in the FE space,,"mdo,mdo",2017-09-28 12:52:23,2017-10-18 21:09:02

IS,Bootstrap v4 Overriding Mixins,Has any thought been put into overriding Bootstrap mixins I have a use case where for example I want to override the definition of a bootstrap mixin to provide additional styles or modify existing styles slightly The problem with this is that SASS does not use the overridden mixin in certain cases such as in an include statement More details here For example I have overriden the color yiq mixin and then the button variant mixin The button variant mixin uses the correct redefined color yiq mixin because it was defined prior to the redefinition of the button variant mixin However the badge variant mixin references the previously defined color yiq mixin because I have not overridden the badge variant mixin The flow is something like color yiq defined by Bootstrap button variant mixin defined by Bootstrap badge variant mixin defined by Bootstrap color yiq redefined by me button variant redefined be me The output looks like the following pay attention to the text colour for the btn warning and badge warning image It would seem that the only way around this that I can think of is to redefine every single mixin that uses the color yiq mixin which seems massively overkill I can not be the only person in the world who would want to override a Bootstrap SASS mixin surely Any ideas,,"XhmikosR,mdo",2017-08-16 17:17:16,2017-10-23 02:48:49
