you are able Version latest Platform all Subsystem Modules CAVEAT The author of this issue recognizes it involves a subsystem of node that has been locked and that there is a somewhat heated history around the subsystem This may create the potential of any nodejs decision makers in immediately dismissing this issue out of hand as a non starter It is humbly and respectfully requested the issue be given equal consideration as any other issue and that it be recognized it is intended to solve a real problem that is fundamentally a result of the amazing success and wide usage of node It should also be noted that the implementation this issue recommends in no way breaks the current algorithm implemented by the affected subsystem that when activated is fully interoperable with the current algorithm while conceptually embracing the simplicity of the current algorithm that it must be explicitly activated and that it is meant to address problems primarily encountered during development time activities The author has implemented the solution this issue suggests in a fork branch of node in less than 50 lines of code 35 in javascript 10 in C and should response to this issue be positive would immediately create a pull request and fully support and implement any issues with the PR Problem Statement It is unlikely anyone would dispute that npm has contributed greatly to the wide adoption and use of node It seams nodejs itself has recognized npm as the defacto standard node package manager as it is included with node installers This is important to this issue as it really addresses how node and npm work together with respect to how modules are stored and referenced as dependencies of other modules It is typical that developers within the node ecosystem may eventually often quickly come to have dozens of node based projects on their development machines where each project is stored in its own project folder As a consequence of how npm currently manages installation of modules this creates two basic problems Problem One Storage Space Because npm creates physical copies of modules when a developer requests it to install all descendant dependencies rooted in a given package json file typically the root package json of a project for some module be it a top level entry point type module or shared library type module it is often the result that a version of a referenced dependency module and all its decedent dependencies are physically residing on the machine multiple times This in combination with typical numbers of node based projects on a developers machine often results in gigabytes of storage being consumed for example the author has 90 projects consuming almost 50 GB in just redundant copies of dependency modules While it could be argued this is not that big of a problem considering the continuing decline of the cost of storage especially around SSDs it should not be ignored Besides the consumed space which back of the napkin math shows is typically 20 30 times more than what is actually necessary if module versions were only ever physically installed in one place then referenced when needed there is also how it impacts basic activities such as deleting projects optimal use of the underlying OS is file cache and others Problem Two Install Duration A significant amount of time is taken by npm to unpack and copy modules when a developer requests an install of a package json isignificant' is in comparison to simply referencing an already installed module back of the napkin math and initial empirical observation shows referencing an existing physical installation can be 30 times faster than always copying Installation time impacts the initial install of a project package but there are other instances when full installs occur beyond the initial one These typically occur for two primary reasons although there may be others 1 During development of a package one or more of its dependencies needs to be upgraded Npm does not have the best history of pulling this off with out problems and at times what is required is the deletion of the entire node modules folder for the project and a re install of the project is module dependency tree 2 At times a developer must implement a bug or enhancement on an early version of a project and the early version has a different module version dependency tree Like reason 1 above it is often best to delete the node modules folder and re install Problem Impact If the above issues occurred once or twice every few months they probably are not 'problems' However relative to a developer is involvement in the node ecosystem the above issues can occur several times a month or more and it ends up becoming more a problem akin to wouldeath by a thousand paper cuts' Root Problem It should be obvious to the knowledgeable reader that the obvious solution is to simply symlink modules The documentation modules addenda package manager tips for the Modules subsystem implies that in principal package managers should be able to implement this However in practice with npm this cannot be achieved as npm allows the specified version of a module is dependencies to not be unary but effectively a list of possible versions where the 'highest' version as determined by semver semantics is chosen at install time This means that two or more projects that depend on the same module version may end up installing slightly differing versions of the dependencies the common module version itself depends on Because a module is dependencies can be placed in the node modules' subdirectory of the module this means that the module version can not be physically installed once and still allow npm to offer reasonable guarantees as to the versions of the entire module dependency tree of a given project when symlink'ing all modules the only way to guarantee is to physically copy the modules Note npm offers bundling and shrink wrapping to precisely control dependencies at the version level but this is a tangent to this issue This is because the only way node currently allows a module is dependencies to be precise is by installing those dependencies in a sub directory named 'node modules' underneath the module is directory Solution Implement a dev mod res switch and NODE DEV MOD RES environment variable in node which stands for wouldevelopment time module resolution' which activates augmenting node is behavior in two ways 1 Search for a module is dependencies not just in a subdir of the module named 'node modules' but then in an adjacent directory to the module named ' module node modules' For example in node is example under Loading from node modules folder modules loading from node modules folders the list and order of the directory searches becomes home ry projects node modules bar js home ry projects node modules bar js home ry node modules bar js home ry node modules bar js home node modules bar js home node modules bar js node modules bar js 2 Preserve symlinks for all module paths including the entry module which in combination with the NODE DEV MOD RES allows npm to implement it is lifecycle steps that depend on installed modules With this augmentation all modules can by physically installed once on a machine while they and their dependencies can be symlinked and a module version that happens to be symlinked in multiple projects can still have its dependencies effectively determined symlinked specific to the project it is being used in Note node is Modules documentation warns that preserving symlinks can cause unexpected behavior specifically siting that node will fail if two different symlinks refer to the same native node module This can be easily addressed by using the module is specified path to determine if a module should be loaded but always using the realpath to determine if the module has already been loaded The current fork branch does not implement this but the author would do so should this issue garner positive support The author of this issue and a node fork branch of its implementation has also implemented a preliminary fork barnch to npm to work in combination with the dev mod res switch The change is the addition of a new command to npm called 'mount' which is conceptually identical to 'install' except it symlinks modules and symlinks dependencies into module node modules folders The current implementation of 'mount' in npm makes slight adjustments to its 'install' command and is relatively low impact to npm from an amount of code perspective about a 100 lines sofar However it has currently only been implemented enough to prove the concept Depending on the response to this issue the author would fully implement 'mount' in npm Thank you for your valuable time in reading

IS,Research Discussion Smash ons vs add ons to simplify access to native libraries,Add ons are a cool way to let node js code access native code be it OS api is or other native libraries However deploying add ons means that either A the target machine must have a minimal build tool chain which may not always be the case on a production server or that B the add on must be prebuilt for all possible platforms and then downloaded yuck And building add ons means being adept in C C and quite familiar with V8 is api is and internals I know other VM is offer marshalling services like NET is P Invoke that lets the VM get access to native stuff without first requiring some code getting compiled to native form It seems to me most add ons today are just mostly marshallers Now I'm sure a full on native marshaller built as an add on can provide the best marshalling performance but I know from my own experience in other runtime worlds there is a bunch of use cases like just wanting to a call a couple OS methods that could be handled just fine performance wise with a built in marshalling service I also know that in some cases some types are expensive to marshall and if it is a 'chatty' api using a built in marshalling service would not be ideal performance wise but would still be adequate and a reasonable trade off to the aforementioned constraints of building native add ons Has anyone thought of or looked at the possibility of including a marshalling service directly in node Besides me I have named a node module that calls into a native marshaller a smash on because it is funny sounding but also kinda hints at that while easier to make might be a tiny bit less performant in some cases I have ideas on how to add a marshalling service to node and would enjoy doing so I think Just trying to collect the thoughts and opinions of others in the know,,mscdex,2016-11-06 14:50:31,2016-11-06 15:44:55

IS,Research Discussion Faster startup with dynamically generated custom v8 snapshots,If you know about v8 snapshots and node is wouldefault' snapshot you might be able to provide insight into this discussion I seem to be using more and more 'commands' that are node based When I run them like npm it is my understanding node has to reload and recompile the entry js and all its require d modules every time I'm wondering if just before node exited if it could take a v8 snap and save it to a file named to correlate to the full path of entry js obviously optimized to only snap when something changed however so not every time node exited Then when node was launched again it could look for a saved snap based on entry js and just create a new context from that snap effectively getting to an executing state much faster At a high level I'm wondering if my understanding is correct that a v8 snap is a heap dump that can be reloaded into an isolate and that when a new context is created in the isolate it starts with modules already jitted having come from the snap But would not there be some state that was 'left over' from the original snap that could potentially 'infect' the new context in some non deterministic way Like say a module set a flag within itself then the snap was taken then when reloaded the flag would still be set Is there even a possibility in some way to save something from run to run such that entry js and all require would modules do not have to be parsed jitted every time,,"mscdex,mscdex,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis",2016-11-05 00:28:11,2016-11-12 03:23:55

IS,RFI What are the know issues with preserve symlinks,I was informed nodejs would ideally prefer symlinks are always preserved but there are known edge cases that prevent defaulting node to this behavior I'm requesting someone knowledgeable of the issues enumerate them ideally separating them into hypotheticals and actuals if possible For example the documentation alludes to one hypothetical Note however that using preserve symlinks can have other side effects Specifically symbolically linked native modules can fail to load if those are linked from more than one location in the dependency tree Node js would see those as two separate modules and would attempt to load the module multiple times causing an exception to be thrown From the OS perspective loading the same so or dll 2 or more times would not in and of itself cause a fault It also appears the Modules loader code creates a node js side Module instance for each absolute require 'addon node' path passing the Module instance to the loaded addon to initialize This also would not necessarily cause a fault as the library is creating and attaching state to the particular Module instance It is not clear in any docs if v8 would fault if an attempt was made to create a FunctionTemplate in the same Isolate for the same native function which could occur if an addon is Init function were called more than once v8 could easily return the same template on subsequent calls similar to how an OS is dlopen or LoadLibary call behaves If the addon defined static state that was in fact state meant to be specific to a Module instance that could create odd behavior between Module instances and potentially fault but has anyone actually experienced any of this or what the docs alluded to in the real world This is an actual that occurs in the real world preserve symlinks does preserve symlinks for all require calls but strangely not that of the entry js file passed on node is command line This can create real issues when package managers attempt to run lifecyle events that are node command lets who is entry js is located in a symlinked folder under some node modules folder assuming the command let itself was configured in package json to launch with preserve symlinks Providing technical details of all know issues with preserve symlinks is greatly appreciated,,"bmeck,sam-github,Fishrock123,sam-github,jasnell,jasnell",2016-11-18 12:56:50,2016-11-21 21:49:45

IS,Process around new contributors in Node core,Hi everyone I ve been trying to gather some feedback on our collaboration process from talks with other collaborators in particular relatively fresh ones So here s a few things that emerged from that and that I would consider worth mentioning to everybody and at least as a reminder to myself We are doing a good job at making people feel that contributions to core are a significant accomplishment including the changes that don t occur in lib or src That s awesome We should be clearer about what kind of changes are necessary to be performed by the author and what kind of changes can be done when landing Github s new distinction between Approved Changes Required might be helpful but I think it would be good to clarify the distinction every time especially as the philosophy around this varies noticeably among the group of collaborators Likewise there is a wide variance among us when it comes to the tone and role we take when approaching PRs and the effort of outsider contributors We should generally try take on more of a mentoring than a judging role here and if you don t feel that you have the ability to be helpful in a given moment keep in mind that you don t have to review and answer to everything asap Having a large and growing group of collaborators means that the work of guiding people s efforts can be spread out among us Be flexible As collaborators we are very familiar with all of the guidelines and formalities mutually agreed upon in the project but outside contributors often are not Their valuable effort shouldn t be lost just because we are unwilling to help If in doubt trust the collaborator who lands a PR to fix any obvious issues or agreed upon nits themselves A lot of our good first contribution issues are not very well approachable and we largely lack other proper resources that we can point newcomers to NodeTodo and the Code Learn sessions are good steps forward and they clearly show that there is no scarcity of people who are willing to offer a bit of time and effort And again just to be very clear All of this are things where I d like to see myself improve too I m going to close this issue in a few days if no significant discussion around anything comes up in that case just regard this as a general announcement and maybe something to take to heart Also If you think this should have been posted somewhere else please tell me But this seemed like the best way to reach the wider collaborators group,,"addaleax,bnoordhuis,Fishrock123,addaleax,Trott,Trott,thefourtheye,lpinca,addaleax,bnoordhuis,addaleax,Trott,bnoordhuis,addaleax",2016-10-13 23:23:04,2016-12-06 00:30:27

IS,Some questions about buffer doc,Version 7 2 0 Platform Windows 7 x64 Subsystem doc buffer I'm preparing a PR with some small fixes in code examples of the buffer doc and I have stumbled on some puzzles I want to clarify before the PR 1 buf lastIndexOf byteOffset argument explanation buffer buf lastindexof value byteoffset encoding What does the not inclusive remark actually mean In this code not in the doc the byteOffset seems to be inclusive in the search and the result After some research I have found out there is a rather strong correlation between script file size and zeroing of a buffer beginning If the before mentioned fragments are saved in 105 176 bytes file size adjusted by these changes ASCII UTF 8 BOM comments space the first 5 bytes are almost always empty So I have written a weird script to find out more about this correlation Here are some notes about results a Zeroing scheme of buffer bytes is the same inside cycles of a script file size increasing by 8 bytes b Correlation is flaky so the statistics data need to be averaged in the research script and manually filtered after the tests c Buffer alloc size always works safely as intended the stat log is empty i e no non zero bytes schemes are detected and saved d Buffer allocUnsafeSlow size also has some correlation but it is significantly flakier and does not make big zero fragments in the buffer beginning so it could be ignored in this case If somebody is interested in the research code here is the script In the comments there I also give the stat data from a test run on my machine The stat data format is script file size scheme with non zero bytes indexes in created buffers Repeated lines inside 8 bytes cycles are filtered If some flaky case happens inside this cycles it is marked by at the beginning of the line Here is also the diff between new Buffer size and Buffer allocUnsafe size stats So the question is this one is this correlation depends on some hardware software features or is it something stable In the first case it could be ignored in the second case the code examples should be adjusted to fall out of size diapasons that produce big zero fragments at the beginning or buffers otherwise novices could be confused by these examples if they run them by themselves Sorry for my bad English and all the possible obscurity,,"vsemozhetbyt,Fishrock123,vsemozhetbyt,addaleax,vsemozhetbyt,vsemozhetbyt",2016-11-24 12:59:32,2016-12-06 18:23:02

IS,process nextTick node MakeCallback are very bloated,I'm doing some optimizations to an addon and I have found the node MakeCallback and the accompanying process nextTick to be a major bottleneck for calling into JS land I have looked through the code all the way down to the process nextTickCallback or whatever it was called and it is very obvious the whole idea of register this function for next tick is very inefficiently implemented in Node js I have found that if I call from C into JS using the pure V8 function call I get almost 2x the throughput while this brings the problem of not correctly firing the enqueued functions to process nextTick So I'm doing a workaround where I only call MakeCallback on the last function call for that iteration or at least that is somewhat close to what I'm trying to do and this properly fires the enqueued functions It would be nice to have a better control of process nextTick and when to fire it from native land since the current code is like some kind of solve everything with dynamic checks for every possible scenario kind of solution The best idea I have come up with is to MakeCallback into a noop fuction just to get the process nextTick functions to trigger when I'm done with my iteration If addons would get to include the env h they could use TickInfo to check if there are any enqueued functions and then call env get tick callback Call yada yada to take care of that thing more efficiently or you could just add some new functions to node h so that addons can check the current number of functions to call and a function to actually do it Or you could just remove the entire thing and only call the enqueued functions from uv check t so that you only do it once per iteration and not once per every single function call,,"alexhultman,Fishrock123,trevnorris,alexhultman,sam-github,alexhultman,alexhultman,sam-github,sam-github,bnoordhuis,alexhultman,bnoordhuis,alexhultman,bnoordhuis,alexhultman,alexhultman,sam-github,alexhultman,trevnorris,trevnorris,alexhultman,trevnorris,trevnorris,MylesBorins,benjamingr,trevnorris,trevnorris,benjamingr,alexhultman,trevnorris,Trott,alexhultman,trevnorris,alexhultman,trevnorris",2016-12-03 01:16:49,2016-12-13 23:51:07

IS,old flags for previous node versions should result in no op not error for current version,This regards Node versions 6 7 and 4 5 but could possibly involve more versions In v4 5 we could allow for deconstructive assignment with the harmony destructuring flag However in v6 7 if we use that flag it says node bad option harmony destructuring and a quick check node v8 options shows us that the new relevant flag in version 6 x is called harmony destructuring assignment So what that means is that I need some conditionals in my library such that if a user is using a certain version of Node I use the first flag and if the user is using another version of Node I use the second flag Is there a way to mitigate this problem I suppose that one solution could be that using harmony destructuring with Node version 6 should result in a no op just a warning or something since it was a flag that existed in old Node versions,,"mscdex,cjihrig,cjihrig,Fishrock123,Fishrock123,hashseed,targos,bnoordhuis",2016-11-01 16:46:00,2017-01-09 08:55:01

IS,Documentation for HttpClient abort and aborted events mixed up,This issue is actually a problem with the documentation rather than the Node software itself so I hope this is the right place to report it If you look at http event abort you can read the following Event 'abort' Added in v1 4 1 Emitted when the request has been aborted by the client This event is only emitted on the first call to abort Event 'aborted' Added in v0 3 8 Emitted when the request has been aborted by the server and the network socket has closed However when I tested this with Node v6 9 1 a client abort actually resulted in the aborted event rather than the abort event But I do believe it is the documentation that is actually at fault rather than the software Note how the documentation for abort says This event is only emitted on the first call to abort But this only makes sense if it is describing server abortion because that is the only case where the developer calls abort Also semantically I do think it makes sense if the abort event corresponds to the abort call both server side abortion and the aborted event corresponds to when an external party the client has aborted the request So to sum up I think the documentation is mixed up,,"italoacasas,lpinca,lpinca",2017-01-13 12:04:43,2017-01-17 09:41:44

IS,7 5 0 clock gettime runtime failure built with macOS 10 11 and Xcode 8 x,Full build log is here I encountered this problem while working on the 7 5 0 upgrade from Homebrew However in its current form it will cause clock gettime not to be used even if building on macOS 10 12 Sierra The reason is that node specifically sets 'MACOSX DEPLOYMENT TARGET' '10 7' mmacosx version min 10 7 in common gypi which will therefore cause MAC OS X VERSION MIN REQUIRED 101200 to be false Obviously one way to make the patch viable would be to set the correct MACOSX DEPLOYMENT TARGET namely MACOSX DEPLOYMENT TARGET 10 12 when building on Sierra if the Sierra only functions are desired But if MACOSX DEPLOYMENT TARGET will continue to be set to 10 7 and yet you also want to enable clock gettime then some other strategy besides using MAC OS X VERSION MIN REQUIRED at build time will be required Another approach would be to use weak linking which defers the decision until run time whether or not to use the symbol If you want to avoid using MAC OS X VERSION MIN REQUIRED and want to avoid using weak linking then a configure time solution will be needed which not only attempts to compile a sample program using clock gettime but also checks whether it executes The latter is sometimes a show stopper because it can interfere with cross compiling,,"joyeecheung,joyeecheung",2017-02-01 15:32:46,2017-02-09 18:15:37
IS,Handling of CTRL CLOSE EVENT SIGHUP on Windows causes races and deadlocks,Version v7 2 1 Platform Windows 8 10 64 bit Subsystem process Enter your issue details below this comment On Windows when a console window is closed a CTRL CLOSE EVENT is sent to all processes running in that console Applications can register handlers for this event and all registered handlers for all processes in the console are run serially After the handlers for a process finish the process is automatically terminated by windows Further there is a timeout of five seconds If the handler is not finished after five seconds Windows also terminates the process It is also worth mentioning that Windows creates a new thread in the target process and runs the handler functions in this new thread For further details about this see the documentation for SetConsoleCtrlHandler and HandlerRoutine libuv maps this event to SIGHUP so when registering an event listener for SIGHUP on Windows libuv sets up a handler for CTRL CLOSE EVENT L105 L114 This handler emits a SIGHUP event so that the registered listener is called And after that it calls Sleep INFINITE which just causes the current thread to block forever While this approach is understandable as not sleeping would just kill the process the current implementation causes several serious issues I have prepared a repository with scripts demonstrating the issues here First of all once a SIGHUP handler is registered and a CTRL CLOSE EVENT received it is no longer possible to terminate node properly Probably the running thread somehow keeps the process alive See on SIGHUP keeps node alive js This is not completely catastrophic due to the fact that Windows will kill the process after five seconds However this means that the SIGHUP handlers for all other processes in the console get delayed by 5 seconds since they are called serially Using nodejs cluster mode with 12 workers it would already take a minute to shut down the system OK so we can work around this by terminating ourselves after receiving SIGHUP by calling process kill process pid which works for killing us But as a side effect it will cause the next CTRL CLOSE EVENT handler in another process to be called And if this process is already shutting down this can lead to further race conditions and deadlocks Once a SIGHUP handler is registered it is no longer safe to exit the application normally Even after the event loop is drained and node is shutting down a CTRL CLOSE EVENT could arrive Since the SIGHUP handler is still registered a SIGHUP event will be emitted but never received by anyone since node has already shut down and the Sleep INFINITY will kick in causing the process to hang See forktest js OK so we just need to remove our SIGHUP handler right Unfortunately this leads to the next problem Once a SIGHUP handler is registered it is no longer safe to remove it For some reason after receiving a CTRL CLOSE EVENT trying to unregister the handler completely blocks execution of nodejs This is the most serious issue here See removeAllListeners SIGHUP after SIGHUP received blocks event loop js Taken together this makes it completely impossible to properly shut down nodejs on Windows in response to SIGHUP CTRL CLOSE EVENT The only option is to always forcefully kill the node process once a handler for SIGHUP is set up and never trying to remove the handler I think a nicer behaviour would be Always allow removal of the SIGHUP event listener even when a CTRL CLOSE EVENT was received If node terminates normally and the Sleep INFINITY is all that is keeping it running kill the thread and terminate properly,,"sam-github,piscisaureus,sam-github,bzoz,bzoz",2016-12-07 13:46:46,2017-02-09 18:15:37

IS,errors and contradictions in docs for process stdout stderr,This situation keeps changing around but my understanding ATM is that process stdout and process stderr fd 1 and 2 are set blocking when they are files and on UNIX OS X Linux also set blocking when they are TTYs I'm not sure what is done if they are pipes or any of the other possible UNIX devices I think the standard way to describe this in node documentaion is that an API that can block is synchronous it runs to completion whether the OS blocks or not will depend on buffering etc but its the run to completion that is important and to describe non blocking APIs the word asynchronous is used Given that understanding the docs have these problems In processstderr Writes can block when output is redirected to a file Should say that stdout err is synchronous when connected to a file I believe that use of the word can is trying to express that blocking wo not occur unless the O S chooses to block but its not very helpful It could also mean node reserves the right to set the fd to blocking mode or not to so depend on nothing but I do not think it means that Note that disks are fast and operating systems normally employ write back caching so this is very uncommon Probably meant to be a note about previous statement but because of list structure reads as a note on the i and ii bullet points that follow If we wanted to we could say If data is written faster than the OS I O systems can buffer it blocking may occur but that blocking is unusual even when process stderr is synchronous due to modern OS I O buffering strategies Writes on UNIX will block by default if output is going to a TTY a terminal Should say its sync Whether it blocks or not depends on whether TTY buffers fill up The file case used the weasel word can but here we use the emphatic WILL which is a contradictory and its not true that writes to a TTY will block even if the fd is set to blocking Windows functionality differs Writes block except when output is going to a TTY Here its partially restating the can block on files from the earlier paragraph except that the can is omitted So its a contradictory restating of previous docs Should just say TTY writes are async on windows for historical reasons Nowhere in here does it say what happens when stdout stderr is a pipe An important case Is it sync like files and TTYs Async like TTY on Windows Depends on system I do not know and the docs do not say To check if Node js is being run in a TTY context read the isTTY property on process stderr process stdout or process stdin Has a typo a trailing isTTY does not have to have same value for stdin out err This sentence should say stderr is attached to a TTY if the isTTY property is set and should say nothing about stdin stdout leave that to their docs In processstdout Copy and paste of the stderr docs all comments apply to it In tty terminals and processstdout TTY Terminals and process stdout Wrongly named should be TTY Terminals and process stdout and process stderr or TTY Terminals and process output The process stderr and process stdout streams are blocking when outputting to TTYs terminals on OS X Legally speaking not wrong since OS X is considered UNIX and the above is true for UNIX but is very misleading since it implies they are not blocking for Windows and Linux which is not true Should say stderr out are synchronous when writing to TTYs on UNIX to agree with previous docs as a workaround for the operating system is small 1kb buffer size Not my understanding do not know where that crept in Its sync because users expect console log 'hello' process exit 0 to not exit until the I O has been written so the I O has to be sync not async asynchronous vs synchronous consoles The console functions are usually asynchronous unless the destination is a file That directly contradicts the docs for process stdout and process stderr unless by usually on windows is meant and on OS X and Linux is considered unusual but I think its just a misstatement Additionally console functions are blocking when outputting to TTYs terminals on OS X as a workaround for the OS is very small 1kb buffer size This is to prevent interleaving between stdout and stderr Copied verbatim from tty terminals and processstdout including with the problems Entire section should be replaced by a web link to tty terminals and processstdout I will PR improvements to this text after my understanding of how it currently works is confirmed,,"sam-github,Fishrock123,Fishrock123,sam-github,Fishrock123,Fishrock123,addaleax",2017-01-04 20:34:11,2017-02-16 17:15:16

IS,Assert is raised when emitting 'connection' event,Version 4 7 2 Platform Linux Hey I have recently came across a very strange issue which I believe is a bug related to a misuse of streams with httpParsers It is quite easy to reproduce using the following code Then when a HTTP CONNECT request is received the process crashes because of the following assert node src stream base h 215 void node StreamBase Consume Assertion consumed false ' failed After spending some time in debugging this I found out that the following flow causes the assertion 1 The function 'onParserExecuteCommon' in http server js is called and it calls to 'unconsume' with the socket is external stream 2 My handler is called as you can see in the attached code I have registered to 'connect' event 3 When I emit the 'connection' event with the received socket the function 'connectionListener' in http server js is called It then executes the following line currently line 334 in http server js parser consume external This line raises the assertion If I understand correctly what actually happens here is that some code consumes the stream then unconsumes it and finally consumes it again Clearly no assertions should be raised and the fact that an assertion is raised probably indicates that some property was not cleared successfully from the stream I have opened a PR with a fix to this issue After applying this fix my application works as expected with apparently no degradation at all Any help will be appreciated Thanks,,"Kasher,evanlucas",2017-01-26 12:58:16,2017-03-22 10:51:43

IS,question Average CPU consumption range and threshold for Node js apps in Production,Given that Node js provides a single threaded asynchronous event driven programming model which handles the I O and CPU bound operations efficiently through multiplexing between them consider this program Client code Server code In short some clients are connecting and reconnecting to a server and downloading some data From server standpoint it is addressing the needs of many clients triggered by events in the uv loop in a heavily concurrent manner The top command shows that node is utilizing more that 99 of CPU time In a multi threaded server program execution environment such as Java application server which works with a thread pool to handle concurrent clients a healthy CPU consumption is considered to be less than 20 IMO In node the increased CPU consumption is understood to be root caused by increased activity by a single thread across many transactions without blocking on I O and consuming most or all of its CPU share And in this case I do not see any issue as the increased consumption is translated to useful work done But then what is optimal range of CPU consumption which is considered to be healthy And what is the threshold point beyond which one should start suspecting its consumption and start profiling for CPU Are there guidance values available Thanks in advance,,"bidipyne,mscdex,bidipyne,gireeshpunathil,joyeecheung,bidipyne,joyeecheung,bidipyne",2017-03-20 13:43:43,2017-03-27 12:46:09

IS,buffer discuss future direction of Buffer constructor API,In today s CTC meeting we discussed reverting the DeprecationWarning for calling Buffer without new that was introduced in v7 PR up here and it became clear that we need to come up with a long term plan on what exactly we want to achieve how to do that and improve our messaging about it both before and after our actions I ll try to sum up what exactly we are talking about obviously I am somewhat biased having been involved in plenty of the previous discussion here This has still gotten pretty long btw so I hope a lot of people will find the information in here useful enough to warrant a Wall of Text The Buffer constructor has the usability flaw that it accepts input with different type signatures so new Buffer 'abcdef' and new Buffer 100 will both return valid buffers and in the latter case the Buffer will contain 100 bytes of unitialized memory This is a security problem for two reasons 1 When passing unvalidated user input e g from a JSON request to the Buffer constructor where a string is expected but a number is actually passed uninitialized memory will be returned Passing the value 100 here will return a slice of memory that may contain garbage but generally can contain any value previously stored in memory including credentials source code and much more has a pretty good write up of this 2 Accidentally accepting large numeric values can very quickly increase resource usage and can be turned into a Denial of Service attack against vulnerable applications Again has a very good write up on these security issues at It predates the current Buffer alloc Buffer from situation but it contains a helpful FAQ with answers to questions like Why not just make Buffer number zero fill everything by default So far in Node v6 0 0 the safer Buffer alloc Buffer from API was introduced and later backported to the v5 10 0 and v4 5 0 releases Additionally v6 0 0 came with a documentation only deprecation of the old Buffer API In June was opened which seeks to deprecate the old Buffer API using a runtime deprecation i e printing a single warning per Node process when Buffer or new Buffer is executed for the first time Currently that PR is still open A reduced version of it was landed as a semver major change in v7 0 0 that emits and displays DeprecationWarning s for uses of Buffer only but excludes uses of new Buffer I had summarized the goals and possible actions before that decision was made in issuecomment 241355246 And has written a then current long term plan in issuecomment 240753218 that would include runtime deprecations of new Buffer in v8 0 0 and later actual breaking changes to the Buffer constructor The reason for this distinction was trying to keep the possibility of making Buffer a proper ES6 class at some point in the far far future open which would mean that calling new Buffer may always work Effects of turning Buffer into a class would be proper subclassability and breaking Buffer without new It is however completely possible to add a separate class to the API that would behave like the current Buffer implementation does only with these differences As a result of that deprecation for Buffer without new in v7 0 0 significant pushback from well known members of the community ensued both in the threads on and On the one hand it became clear that we failed in our messaging to make clear that the primary motivation for that change was helping our users avoid serious security issues on the other hand the added deprecation warning seemed to be incongruent with the expectations of stability and backwards compatibility that module authors and consumers have as far as Node core is concerned As a result of this the CTC decided to consider reverting the deprecation warning possibly temporarily and the corresponding PR is in The decision on that has yet to be made but the desire has been expressed to reach a decision soon to limit the number of v7 x versions with possibly incongruent behaviour From following the discussions it is obvious that the path forward is a contentious issue right now the opinions range from never introducing a runtime deprecation for any version of the Buffer constructor to applying one for all uses of it at the next semver major release in v8 0 0 The strongest and most frequently expressed argument for fully runtime deprecating the Buffer constructor soon remains that users may not be aware that parts of their application use an unsafe API and should be warned about that On the other side the warning itself is perceived as a very disruptive change to the ecosystem suggesting that it is definitely worth exploring alternative ways to reduce the usage of both Buffer and new Buffer cc collaborators It may or may not be obvious from the way I articulate my thoughts here I try to stick to stating facts but in hindsight I regret writing it this

IS,Using node in a Win32 GUI Application fails stdin stderr stdout,Hello I'm using and have tried both node 0 10 3x and 0 11 x and the node bleeding edge and have an issue i'm hoping someone can shed some light on I'm embedding node into a Win32 GUI app that is to say Subsystem Windows and wWinMain rather than the default subsystem console Windows applications do not setup a proper stderr stdin stdout handles When node Load attempts to run the application exits with either code 1 for node 0 11 or code 8 for node 0 10 I have traced the problem down It starts with libuv win handle c L56 in the function uv guess handle line 56 that returns a FILE TYPE UNKNOWN for the file descriptor 1 or 2 stdout or stderr if the subsystem is compiled as Windows This is called when node Load runs specifically in src node js the function createWritableStdioStream L483 line 483 The createWritableStdioStream causes an error to be thrown thats caught by node cc L2182 line 2182 The FatalException exits the application since we are in a windows GUI application we do not see this as its printed to stderr which does not exist making it incredibly difficult to track down Other related files that are used in the stack trace but does not seem relevant tty wrap line 89 L89 I have tried a few solutions but to no success 1 Create a Windows console buffer when acting like a GUI app this allows you to capture stdin stdout for application running as a GUI Unfortunately since lib win handle c line 56 uses the low level file descriptor and not the stdin stdout stream this has no effect as the console buffer simply replaced the stdin stdout global streams not the 0 1 FD descriptors 2 Tried redirecting stdin stdout stderr using named pipes with CreateNamedPipe This also had no effect for the same reason as 1 3 Tried reopening the stream to re assign them this no effect see above 4 Looked into hiding the console window and just compiling with subsystem console however this causes a flicker when the app loads but does successfully fix the issue 5 Tried using AttachConsole to a faked child processes' console the child process is a dummy process that is created with CreateProcess with the console attribute hidden This sort of worked but caused halting problems as the stdout stdin are themselves unable to create a stream buffer for some reason 6 Tried simply closing or opening the low level fd stdout stderr however this had no effect and threw assertion errors from Windows About to give up I thought that SOMEONE SOMEWHERE must have fixed this issue I looked at applications that use node in a GUI app and found two solutions 1 Node webkit modifies node js to create dummy handles for stdio if its on win32 This is not optimal as i would like to be able to only force the dummy handles for stdin stdout stderr if there really is not a console available 2 Atom and others seem to take the approach of second process launches which creates a second process of themselves the first launched with a subsystem windows then relaunched with STARTUPINFO on CreateProcess set to hide the console but launched as a console application This is not an optimal solution either as I stated in 5 above there are corner cases where the system cannot create a std stream but can deliver a valid file descriptor for the stream it causes assertion errors in windows open oshandle unsure why Although it does seem to work for 95 of the use cases i have seen For obvious reason e g when running as a GUI I do not have any use for standard in outs the optimal fix would be to create dummy stream handles on node Load for these instances similar to node webkit but allow it to be a configurable option and not by default TL DR Node fails with no workaround if it can not find stdin stdout like in a GUI app My first question Does anyone know of another alternate way of getting this to work that I have not tried I would rather not submit a patch nor modify the node code as its upstream My second question If I submit a patch for node to help alleviate these issues would creating dummy stdin stdout stderr be the best solution is there alternate approaches recommended if I need to modify node Thanks Trevor Linton,,"seishun,gibfahn,bzoz,bzoz",2017-03-25 14:13:29,2017-04-03 13:29:46

IS,Should util deprecate be removed from the public API,Reading from the docs it is not clear whether util deprecate should be used by userland modules or not There is the preamble that states The util module is primarily designed to support the needs of Node js' own internal APIs However many of the utilities are useful for application and module developers as well Reading this I would guess that it is ok to use util deprecate The output however looks like this The node prefix is indicating that the deprecation warning is coming from node itself introduced with If util deprecate is meant for internal use only I think it would be better to remove it from the official documentation because it can be misleading for both the library authors and library users Just as background I was using this method for a breaking change in webpack is loader utils issue 206266981 This module is used by almost every loader so it is very likely that it appeared at least once in the console of every webpack user I was using this method because I think it is good to have a unified way of handling deprecations especially in combination with the command line flags provided by node I just wanted to stick to the community default at least as it appeared to me Judging from the feedback however many users did not know where the message was coming from and what to do And I think this is also due to the unfriendly appearance of the message It is lacking the necessary information whether if it is a problem the developer must fix or the library author You could use trace deprecation but if you never heard of util deprecate you do not know that this flag exists Having said this this is what I would like to change Either remove util deprecate from the documentation or remove the node prefix In any case The output of the warning can be improved For example we could add the last one or two lines of the stack trace by default to reveal which library is causing the deprecation warning We could also add an URL to the documentation that lists all the available cli flags I think elm is doing an incredible good job of explaining errors problems,,"sam-github,seishun,jasnell,sam-github,jasnell,sam-github,Fishrock123,addaleax",2017-03-02 01:07:27,2017-04-29 23:39:33

IS,Should Node js update to newer V8 than the current stable branch,Whenever Node js updates to a new version of V8 the latest stable version is chosen For Node 8 this is V8 5 7 V8 is active branch is always three months ahead currently 5 9 That version of Node js then undergoes active development for six months according to this before release So at the time of Node 8 is release V8 5 9 would long have turned stable V8 only merges important fixes to older branches and I do not expect API changes to occur unless critically necessary and I do not remember this every happening Taking the newest V8 works for Chromium so I wonder whether it makes sense to update to the V8 is active branch for a new Node js version The advantage is that Node js gets to ship with a more up to date V8 language features performance awesomeness etc and V8 has to merge critical fixes to fewer past versions which is not only more convenient but also safer,,"hashseed,gibfahn,addaleax,hashseed,cjihrig,jasnell,hashseed,fhinkel,jasnell,addaleax,jasnell,mhdawson,fhinkel",2017-03-28 10:54:46,2017-05-04 09:18:13

IS,Another case of possibly deoptimizing use of arguments in libs,In this issue I have missed a case which is much more difficult to trace That report has caused some fixes so maybe this is also worth reporting However some disclaimer is needed I could get the theory or its application wrong here I could miss or detect wrongly some cases I am not sure if optimization is worth refactoring in each case Moreover spread is increasingly gaining speed now so maybe upgrade to it is more worth efforts I Definition Leaking arguments is considered safe only within func apply context arguments However this call site must be monomorphic See the last warning in this chapter what is safe arguments usage To be monomorphic func must have the same hidden class According to this comment comment 2345466631 these functions have different hidden classes function with an additional property function without this property common function bound function via bind common function arrow function strict mode function sloppy mode function So each func apply context arguments fragment should be checked for func monomorphism II Example of deoptimization This is the code to compare two cases with monomorphic and polymorphic call sites In the comment below the code you can see the time difference and deoptimization warning III Types of cases If I get it right there are three group of cases here from the most dangerous to the least dangerous 1 func is an argument gotten from a userland via public API directly or via a call chain We can not guarantee monomorphism here for example a user can give both common and arrow functions as arguments So maybe in these cases arguments should be copied before the call as in many other lib places 2 func is a declared public method Here is a small danger still a user can add a property to the public function at any time Therefore maybe these cases are worth to be refactored as well 3 func is a private function declared or given as direct indirect argument The monomorphism of this func should be checked across all the code base chains IV Occurrences in Node js libs 1 func is an argument gotten from a userland via public API dns js callback in makeAsync asyncCallback L83 is given from exports lookup exports lookupService and possibly via many exports resolve functions fixed events js this listener in onceWrapper L312 is given from this chain onceWrap EventEmitter prototype once or EventEmitter prototype prependOnceListener fixing seems to cause performance downgrading fs js cb in anonymous makeCallback L135 is given from many more than 20 fs i e exports functions this anonymous ones are one time unoptimizable functions repl js this completer in REPLServer prototype complete L803 is given from this chain REPLServer exports start stream readable js stream method in Readable prototype wrap stream L807 is given directly internal util js exports deprecate fn msg code L19 and fn L43 in exports deprecate is given from util deprecate under consideration 2 func is a declared public method net js stream Duplex prototype write in Socket prototype write L661 util js exports format in debugs set exports debuglog L147 util js exports format in exports log L936 http server js this writeHead in ServerResponse prototype writeHeader L233 internal process js require 'util' format in process rawDebug setupRawDebug L252 3 func is a private function Most detected cases seem to be OK In addition there are some cases I could not define which group they belong to and if they are monomorphic I can not trace all the chain here got out of memory and stack overflow in my mind tls wrap js this parent name in tls wrap TLSWrap prototype name L327 fixed internal cluster utils js fn in module exports internal L42 internal cluster child js close in handle close shared L101 internal cluster worker js this destroy in Worker prototype kill L50 internal cluster worker js this process send in Worker prototype send L54 Sorry for my bad English an overall mess in explanation cc v8,,vsemozhetbyt,2017-01-25 18:08:07,2017-05-17 23:01:45

IS,Windows installer can corrupt its npm installation,Version All Platform Windows Subsystem Installer The Windows installer copies the new distribution of Node js in without removing the existing one This can result in corrupted npm installations that either crash or result in unusual behavior This happens when a transitive dependency of npm has moved within its dependency tree For example In Node js 0 10 30 normalize package data is located at npm node modules read package json node modules normalize package data In Node js 7 3 0 it is located at npm node modules normalize package data If you install Node js 0 10 30 and then install Node js 7 3 0 you will end up with normalize package data installed in both locations Then when you run npm and it loads read package json then that will end up with the version of normalize package data that came from 0 10 30 and things wo not behave as you expect An easy way to test this is to create a package with the following package json It is worth also noting that this is only reproducible if you have never updated npm on your Windows system as global modules on Windows are not installed in the same place the installer puts its copy This means that when you update your Node js on Windows you keep all of your existing user installed global modules including npm This detail probably accounts for why reports of this are not more common then they are Obviously using the wrong version of a dependency can cause all sorts of problems The one above is one that I happened to have handy but it is not alone This is one of the things stopping npm from shipping with a flat dependency tree The other thing was allowing folks to update npm on a stock Node js 0 8 install but maybe that is not a concern any more p This will effect any installer that copies without removing the existing installation We do not see reports from non Windows users with this sort of problem so I suspect the other installers do not share this bug,,"iarna,Fishrock123,iarna,gibfahn,joaocgreis,iarna,joaocgreis",2016-12-22 00:47:08,2017-07-08 02:58:30

IS,proposal islab' event on readable streams,Version all Platform all Subsystem stream Background Two common form of using streamed data at the top level are i transform the data before consumption ii pipe the stream into a writeable steam free flow Transformation can be one of reduction aggregation mutation etc At top level these operations work on unit chunk of data Currently data events are generated when the internal buffer has got isome' bytes in it This isome' amount may be either insufficient for the transformer or excess Exception to this is i when the consumer get exact amount of data ii unit of data is one byte This is is because the data channel hold no bearing on the structure of data A workaround is to accumulate the data in an application buffer upon data events and transform when there is a 'unit' amount of data available which the transformer can work with This implies 2 things i data buffering at the app level ii code duplication if the same buffering logic is required in many places Proposal 1 Enable a islab' event for readable streams that will be emitted when the data in the internal buffer is fully formed according to a certain predicate 2 Under default configurations the stream does not exhibit this event 3 To enable this event register a predicate and a listener with the stream The predicate is an application defined lambda which is invoked on the internal stream data every time some bytes arrive into it the lambda should assert whether the data is fully formed and if so the offset into the internal buffer upto which makes one slab The listener is then called with the islab' portion of the content 4 If there are more than one slabs the listener is called as many times If there is fewer bytes no event is produced 5 Pre define some standard lambdas in the core line delimited by n json delimited by stringified form of an object etc 6 If the islab' event is registered mask the wouldata' event for the stream Caller can still use readable read in which case the data is drained and the slab'ing is ignored for the chunk 7 No behavioral difference for the streams created in Object mode Why this is required in the core as opposed to somewhere else 1 Slabing capability at the API level reduces code duplication elsewhere in the stack 2 Stream consumption become more intuitive and convenient Alternatively an abstraction can be built around ReadableStream SlabStream which exhibits this custom behavior the tradeoff between the two a subject of discussion and ratification Usage pattern 1 Thoughts cc streams,,"gireeshpunathil,addaleax,calvinmetcalf,gireeshpunathil,mscdex,calvinmetcalf,gireeshpunathil,mcollina,gireeshpunathil,mcollina,gireeshpunathil,mcollina,gireeshpunathil,mcollina,gireeshpunathil,gireeshpunathil",2017-06-30 10:59:54,2017-07-10 09:51:38

Subsystem NA Enter your issue details below this comment Hi I have just finished reading the docs and made a few notes about some minor issues I found I thought I would dump them here I can do a PR if appropriate I might be misunderstanding some things so did not want to jump in 1 Should tls connect list host and port in the options if they are already params tls tls connect port host options callback 2 Seems weird that path resolve arguments are optional Worth documenting that the method returns ' ' if you pass nothing in path path join paths path path resolve paths 3 The params for path format and path parse are in different orders format is logically wrong based on the diagram under parse path path format pathobject path path parse path 4 There should not be spaces in tlsSocket getPeerCertificate detailed tls tlssocket getpeercertificate detailed 5 net Server shows connections as deprecated net server connections tls Server inherits from this but does not show connections as deprecated tls server connections Should it 6 Is the encoding parameter allowed if the data parameter is not set Should request end data encoding callback be request end data encoding callback http request end data encoding callback 7 dgram has a header dgram module functions before the static methods none of the other pages do this Is the dgram module different or is this just an inconsistency dgram dgram module functions 8 dgram createSocket has two different signatures listed One with type one with object dgram dgram createsocket type callback That is cool but the same sort of thing in the fs module where an options parameter could be a string defining the encoding or an object that has an encoding property and something else is shown as a single signature fs fs readfile file options callback IMO they should both be like dgram that is fs readFile file encoding callback should be listed in addition to fs readFile file options callback But that means lots to change on the fs page 9 There is very minor inconsistency in callback terminology E g socket connect specifies a connectListener which is nice it defines that this is a callback that is the same as 'listening' for the connect event net socket connect options connectlistener But server listen names the parameter just callback net server listen options callback Personally my choice would be the 'on' prefix followed by the event name that would trigger it onConnect onListening etc I think that would make understanding when the callbacks are called easy 10 The example of a dgam sending message unnecessarily converts a string to a buffer since it will be converted to a utf8 Buffer anyway Less complexity in examples is better right Also it vaguely implies that a string is not as valid as a buffer dgram socket send msg offset length port address callback 11 Parameter names are almost always camelCase except in crypto where they are snake case crypto cipher final output encoding Is that an inconsistency or is there meaning in that 12 Using util inspect inside console log is redundant I think Is not it events emitter listeners eventname vm vm runincontext code contextifiedsandbox options vm script runinnewcontext sandbox options 13 Missing apostrophe in run using the vm modules methods vm what does it mean to contextify an object 14 I have no idea about this one but is sandbox really optional in script runInNewContext If I call script runInNewContext options would not it try and make a sandbox out of the options object I went looking through the source but found myself in a strange land and gave up vm script runinnewcontext sandbox options 15 zlib constants is missing added in version and is quite new so this is a problem zlib zlib constants Looks like this commit diff c245d87dba893de0b77c7574f0081633R388 16 zlib codes is not documented Is that on purpose 17 zlib methods all have options as an argument but not shown in square brackets but in the TOC they are shown in square brackets Less important but having the word in the argument list be linked is inconsistent with the other pages The description contains the word 'options' which is linked to the class options section 18 Wording is strange for zlib methods e g Returns a new Deflate object with an options By comparison in net connect the equivalent wording is something like The options are passed to the net Socket constructor 19 Getting picky here but the wording for there being Sync version of methods is different for fs and zlib zlib convenience methods fs file

IS,Changes to file URL formatting in Node v7 cause problems for npm,Version v7 0 0 Platform platform agnostic Subsystem url format IMPACT Before I get into the specifics I want to be clear about what the impact is for npm It is actually pretty limited As best as we can tell this only impacts when saving a file type specifier to a package json with npm not when installing from one As such it can be worked around by editing the package json 7234 introduced a change to how url format printed invalid file type URLs Specifically if someone gave it the invalid file absolute path to file txt it would translate that into the valid file Previously invalid URLs were left unaltered npm is use of file URLs are usually to point at relative paths which is not something file URLs are really setup to support The way npm does this is tack file on the front so npm i S foo becomes file foo and npm i S foo becomes file foo As of v7 those become file and file respectively The first being a reference to on the foo host and the latter being a reference to foo on the host Ok so Node v7 is making legacy URLs healthy where it did not used to and that bit our particular use case We can update npm to work around that but there is an additional wrinkle We do not actually call url format 'file foo' What we call is It would be legit to call this a doc bug and update there imo though ignoring properties in the object form feels odd to me Either way we will be updating our code to not rely on url format,,"iarna,rvagg,Trott,Trott,Trott,jasnell,sam-github,Trott,iarna,iarna,Trott,Trott,iarna,Trott",2016-11-08 22:13:26,2017-07-15 09:40:20

IS,Proposal for better cluster tuning,Currently with the way Cluster is implemented in Node the Master creates a connection handler for the child processes to use This means if we set maxConnections on our child server it is per child This is problematic as it means if say we have one child per core and we are using the default Round Robin load balancing in Cluster we can max out one child while the other child has available connections It would be ideal if we can handle this level of tuning somehow at the master level It seems that we could set the maxConnections at the master level by having the master keep track of total connections and close connections in the load balancer function if the number is greater than the configured value Child behavior could remain unchanged but for optimal tuning a child should ignore its maxConnections value if the master is handling it As it stands we have found that from an ops perspective we need to handle connection back pressure at either the nginx haproxy ATS etc layer in front of our node cluster as the default cluster behavior is far from ideal,,"sam-github,sam-github,Trott",2017-01-13 22:22:58,2017-07-16 01:45:40

IS,Write after end when piping a ClientRequest to ServerResponse,Version v4 8 3 Platform Linux Hey I believe there is a minor issue in http outgoing js code In the constructor the property writable is changed to true L64 this writable true As of my understanding this property is set in the constructor since OutgoingMessage inherits from Stream and in Stream is code this property might be checked to validate that a stream is writable However this property is never changed to false in http outgoing js Even when the message is closed i e the end method was called this property remains true The class OutgoingMessage maintains another property finished which indicates whether the OutgoingMessage was finished already or not In the constructor finished is set to false and later on in the end method it is set to true I believe that finished and writable should have opposite values since when a OutgoingMessage is closed it is not writable anymore and it is finished This minor issue does not have much effect but it might raise a lot of write after end errors especially when piping I can easily catch such errors so the process wo not crash but I guess the error should not be raised in the first place The following simple code reproduces this note that I use the request npm Server As you can see from the stack we reach stream js line 31 In line 30 L30 we can find the condition that should have failed if dest writable So if my OutgoingMessage is writable property was indeed changed to false once it was closed the error would not have been raised at all Note that this probably happens due to race between the client is request that was closed and the server is request or actually the server request is response that got some new data hence the code I attached does not reproduce this immediately and the output may not be the same as I attached I have opened a PR with a fix to this issue 14024 After applying this fix my application works as expected and I never get any write after end errors in my scenario Any help will be appreciated Thanks,,"Kasher,mcollina,Kasher,mcollina",2017-07-01 11:17:29,2017-07-17 16:23:26

IS,Feature request API for debugging node child processes,Kind of recent changes in the debugging feature make it easy to debug a node process with whatever debugger speaks the protocol Most notable perhaps is Chrome DevTools Further a wrapper tool makes it trivial to start a node process with debugging on and launch the debugger on that An example that I'm using is For me experience is smooth and I'm happy until I reach the great wall of the child process For example debugging any test that is run with my favorite test runner is kind of impossible because all of the tests run in child processes and there is no feature to allow running tests in the main process inspect process is considering monkey patching methods of child process for this purpose What I request is an API that will solve this Here s a thought An addition to the debugging protocol that 1 Informs the debugger that a new node child process is going to be launched 1 Allows the debugger to decide whether that process will be debuggable 1 If true the debug port will be provided to the debugger and the debugger could launch a new instance of itself on that,,"eugeneo,eugeneo,eugeneo,Trott,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis",2016-11-15 18:16:35,2017-07-17 16:35:29

IS,Confirmation that the stability definition is correct,cf issuecomment 297731802 thinks the stability definition is wrong for experimental documentation stability index I do not agree and would like confirmation that the docs are correct Node cannot break the ecosystem by changing or removing its APIs without going through its deprecation process even the deprecation process can cause lots of kick back we all remember Buffer The definition of experimental explicitly states that the API is subject to change in a future version It does not even say future major version This means that experimental APIs are explicitly NOT subject to the deprecation process While any individual package author is hopefully aware that they are using an experimental API with no stability guarantees when they type their javascript code out that uses the API and are comfortable with the risk users of their package have no way to know Node does not write warning messages to stderr when experimental APIs are called perhaps it should npm does not refuse to install dependencies that rely on experimental APIs how could it know so its very easy for a user to become dependent on experimental features In my opinion the case for gating experimental APIs via a command line flag is to force the end consumer of a package perhaps a consumer seperated by many layers of package depencies to explicitly recognize that they are depending on experimental node APIs and expect no guarantee of stability Doing this allows node to treat experimental APIs the way the docs say we do experiments we can change or withdraw at will Without a flag we cannot do that experimental APIs are part of our API and we can not and wo not break them whatever the docs say Inspector is an odd case of experimental It was gated behind a flag but only because all debugging is gated It will still be behind a CLI flag when its not experimental URL is a case of something that should have been gated behind a CLI flag or declated stable from the start It was developed based on a fairly stable specification and does not appear to have ever had breaking changes proposed that I noticed but if we had been forced to make breaking changes it could have been very painful for the ecosystem Those are the past though I'm more worried about the future and would like to see agreement that the text is correct and describes our intentions with any future experimental APIs,,"sam-github,sam-github,jasnell,gibfahn,jasnell,targos,sam-github,jasnell,refack,Fishrock123",2017-04-27 17:52:06,2017-07-24 16:56:52

IS,API issue No way to abort file open,This is an issue I have recently come across in production code It is not a technical issue but rather a problem with the File System API itself As described by the at the time of this writing v8 2 1 documentation What I was doing was opening a named pipe for writing while also starting a process that would read from it However there was a chance that starting the process would fail or be aborted meaning the pipe would never be opened for reading Named pipes on Linux block opening until it is open for both reading and writing so the writing would stall To be clear Aborting is an acceptable runtime condition and is easily detected In this case the write to the pipe would also be aborted The problem is fs open would never call its callback if the abort happened before the reading side was open and the request would leak at the end of the program causing node js to fail to exit My workaround was to detect if the file has not yet opened for writing at the time of the abort and open a dummy reader to unblock the open function So the API issue is There is no way to tell fs open to stop trying once it is been started This can be an issue with any non guaranteed resource requests Named pipes are one example but network files are also one There needs to be a way to programmatically say on second thought I do not really need this file This problem only exist with fs open since fs write or fs read can be easily aborted by simply closing the file with fs close I have tested it to be safe although it would be nice if this was an API guarantee My suggestion would be for fs open to return some temporary descriptor that could be used to call an fs abortOpen function or something similar,,"bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis",2017-07-25 15:41:45,2017-07-26 18:06:08

IS,Re enabling V8 snapshots,As part of the July 11 2017 security release we disabled V8 snapshots to mitigate hash flooding attacks against Node servers The problem is that the snapshot is built at build time and whatever the hash seed got used at that time gets baked into that particular Node js binary Disabling snapshots has some negative performance memory footprint consequences for code that heavily relies on creating lots of V8 contexts e g via vm runInNewContext Startup time might also be negatively affected although this should not be substantial This issue is for discussing a way to getting V8 snapshots enabled back again There are some alternatives that have been proposed 1 When the snapshot is deserialized generate a new hash seed and then rehash all hash tables in the snapshot including all dictionary mode objects 1 Hook into the Node js install or startup process to periodically arefresh' the snapshot blob on disk This has ergonomic issues requires modification of installers and it may not be possible to write to disk in all environments 1 Generate a new snapshot on each startup and re use it for future contexts This will help address performance of vm runInNewContext but will not help with the default startup time 1 Modify the V8 object model so that each hash table has its own seed This will have performance consequences even for code that does not need multiple contexts cc v8 ctc,,"ofrobots,refack,ofrobots,hashseed,hashseed,refack,refack,hashseed,ofrobots,targos,hashseed,refack,hashseed,mhdawson,hashseed,bnoordhuis,mcollina,hashseed,hashseed,hashseed,bnoordhuis,refack,hashseed,hashseed,refack,hashseed,hashseed,hashseed,hashseed,refack,hashseed,addaleax,hashseed,refack,refack",2017-07-11 17:30:21,2017-07-28 16:03:58

IS,htop does not show memory spike yet I get allocation failure GC in old space requested,Node version v6 9 3 Can anyone confirm that his might be an issue of maximum string length being triggered where I call console log If not then what is causing this problem I have doubts that string conversion is the problem as the script does seem successful in converting the object to a string When I tail f the log 66 kilobytes of data are written before the script dies with the allocation failure So the object is converted to a string and begins to write to the log and it dies half way Which does not make any sense Here is the back story I built an API that runs on NodeJS and HapiJS Instead of making calls to the database I decided this app would load all data at startup and hold it in memory This took about 3 gigs of RAM No worries We have this on a server with 16 gigs of RAM and we run it like this usr local bin node max old space size 9000 home ec2 user daemons deduplication api v10 dupe res server js This version of our app works perfectly It took us a few months but eventually we worked out all the bugs and it has been running flawlessly for several weeks now It holds 3 gigs of data in Memory and it we allow it another 6 gigs of RAM to work with It never hits its memory limit However it is annoying that we are relying on an in memory cache since the data becomes obsolete fairly fast Restarting every hour when startup is 5 minutes is a pain So I decided I would write a new version of the app which calls upon the live database That is instead of holding data in memory it would simply request the data from the database when it is needed Since each particular database query should only fetch at most a few megabytes of data this new version of the app should only need a tiny fraction of what the other app is using And yet out of an excess of caution and since we have plenty of RAM I decided to run it with almost 3 gigs usr local bin node max old space size 3000 home ec2 user daemons deduplication api v11 dupe res server js This new version when an API call comes in does a database call and fetches some data I wanted to see the data being returned in this new version so I try Object keys all worthwhile comparisons arecords' forEach function uuid id console log all worthwhile comparisons arecords' console log all worthwhile comparisons arecords' var profile id all worthwhile comparisons arecords' uuid id document from database profile id 0 var type of profile all worthwhile comparisons arecords' uuid id document from database type of profile 0 var delete this record false The script seems to die when I call console log The error I get FATAL ERROR CALL AND RETRY LAST Allocation failed JavaScript heap out of memory 1 node Abort usr local bin node 2 0x1095ddc usr local bin node 3 v8 Utils ReportApiFailure char const char const usr local bin node 4 v8 internal V8 FatalProcessOutOfMemory char const bool usr local bin node 5 v8 internal Factory NewRawTwoByteString int v8 internal PretenureFlag usr local bin node 6 v8 internal Runtime StringBuilderJoin int v8 internal Object v8 internal Isolate usr local bin node 7 0x3cceb55092a7 Last few GCs 280170 ms Mark sweep 2981 3 3034 0 2980 3 3034 0 MB 24 1 0 0 ms 0 5 ms in 5 steps since start of marking biggest step 0 2 ms allocation failure GC in old space requested 280191 ms Mark sweep 2980 3 3034 0 2980 3 3034 0 MB 21 5 0 0 ms allocation failure GC in old space requested 280220 ms Mark sweep 2980 3 3034 0 2982 7 3003 0 MB 28 7 0 0 ms last resort gc 280248 ms Mark sweep 2982 7 3003 0 2985 1 3003 0 MB 27 6 0 0 ms last resort gc What is confusing to me is that when I run this I'm using htop to watch the memory usage on the server and I never see a spike in memory usage I'm not sure how to read this Is it saying that this database query is using 3 gigs of RAM But somehow htop does not see this Is the problem the limit on string length in Javascript And therefore the problem is that console log is trying to convert the data object into a string I'm looking for direction about how to debug this Is this a problem with Node or is the problem in my app,,addaleax,2017-08-01 19:08:46,2017-08-02 16:31:56

IS,Should we continue to support FreeBSD,I'm opening this because at the moment the update to V8 6 0 is blocked by FreeBSD 10 that cannot compile V8 because of a bug in Clang I opened an issue about that on May 9 and a suggestion was to upgrade Clang so I opened another issue on the build repo for that on May 16 Nothing really happened for about a month and then investigated a bit and found that we would need to update Clang to 3 8 to avoid the bug contacted the maintainers of the Node port for FreeBSD and it seems that upgrading Clang is not an option That leaves with having to find and apply a workaround to V8 for this bug I already spent a few hours on this myself without success so far The thing is I do not think it is my responsibility as the one who usually does the V8 upgrades to fix platform issues I would like to question the presence of FreeBSD in the Tier 2 support type because it seems to me that we do not have enough collaborators who care about it and who are ready to spend the time needed to make it green on our CI Refs Refs cc platform freebsd ctc,,"targos,mcollina,bnoordhuis,targos,bnoordhuis,jbergstroem,mcollina,jbergstroem,mhdawson,addaleax,refack,targos",2017-07-20 06:52:00,2017-08-03 08:51:43

IS,Reorganise the NodeJS Foundation,details So over the last few weeks there has been a bit of drama within the node community and has resulted in many words being said and many discussions have happened across various mediums This has resulted in a fork of the project and the situation still appears not to be fully resolved Yet again we see the reason why quite frankly humans suck This project as far as I am aware is about the creation and development of a programming language that is designed for many people use similar to that of PHP Python and many many others Yet for some reason politics has somehow infiltrated this project and is getting in the way of people actually writing code and essentially doing their jobs I would like to propose a simple idea that I think would work really well 1 disband node tsc and delete archive the repo 2 disband node board and delete archive the repo 3 disband node inclusivity and delete archive the repo Then select a core group of users who are capable of working together without issue and let them be the nodejs maintainers Ensure that such individuals are banned from using social media of any kind for the duration that they are a member no good can come from social media as we have seen and ensure each member is focused on the development of the NodeJS platform and its releases LTS If the NodeJS foundation cannot do this I would like to suggest contacting Microsoft Google or Facebook and handing the project over to them and letting them create a team handle the future development of the language VSCode seems to be doing well When tweets such as this Men are fragile often incompetent babies with no sense of humor and I like reminding them of their inferiority are being made by people with control and power over a major piece of software that is the time when you need to think about whether you want such individuals involved a project as important as NodeJS and co There is a reason the Linux kernal development works so well less time bickering more time working All the energy that has gone into the last few weeks of argument could have been better spent writing code fixing issues and shipping releases Instead there are blogs titled Values Inclusion and the Node js Foundation which is a complete waste of time People need to be reminded the only thing that matters is that issues are closed bugs are fixed features are added and releases are shipped You are not a special snowflake the work you have done on this project will probably be forgotten and nobody really cares who did what or who wrote that particular line of code Anyone is replaceable and maybe Google should just release a fork of Node themselves and let them get on with this project without this stupid drama The fact that a CTC and an inclusivity repo are required should highlight the fact that this project is not about writing code and shipping releases but about discussing pointless politics and human problems It is not needed it is not required no other language has this because the only thing they care about is writing the damn code Heck Facebook has already released yarn that was a collaboration with Google and others Maybe it is a plausible idea after all Thank you details,,MylesBorins,2017-09-03 17:05:27,2017-09-03 17:39:02

IS,http2 session closing after 2 minutes even if activity,I have a client which sends a regular 1 minute api request to my http2 server On the server I have added on a listener for a session event and on that session added a stream event listener Then for each of the possible session events and stream events listed in the docs I have added listeners for those I am doing this in order to get better understanding as to why 14925 is happening What I have discovered is that as the client makes its first heartbeat the session is opened Then at almost exactly within a millisecond two minutes the session is closed regardless of the fact that at least one other request had been made on that session at one minute from open I am also measuring the gap between closing the session and starting a new one and that is just short of to within 10 milliseconds one minute This indicates to me that the one minute heartbeat request is what is causing a new session to be made Is this is what is expected I have tried reading the http2 spec but its very light on what a session I think it calls it a connection is Because of the natural synchronisation of the heartbeat to the session boundaries and the fact that I see an aborted event on the stream at the instance 14925 is triggered I am wondering if its possible for session timeout because thats what it appears to be ALTHOUGH no timeout event is fired to be killing of the heartbeat request whilst it is in progress If that IS the case that seems to be very undesirable behaviour,,"benjamingr,mcollina,mcollina,apapirovski,apapirovski,mcollina,apapirovski,jasnell",2017-09-03 08:21:46,2017-09-07 18:40:14

PR,crypto fix Node SignFinal,This is a bit of a mess Originally OpenSSL mixed up hashes with signature algorithms An EVP MD was nominally a hash but they sometimes had key types associated with them for signining purposes So EVP sha256 was secretly associated with RSA and named both SHA256 and RSA SHA256 but DSA was not usable with EVP sha256 and instead one used EVP dss1 which is identical to EVP sha1 but associated with DSA instead Way back in OpenSSL 1 0 0 OpenSSL added the newer EVP DigestSign and EVP DigestVerify functions which should be used instead of the legacy EVP Sign and EVP Verify functions which Node used up until recently The newer functions no longer confuse hash functions and signature algorithms and are the supported way to use more complex algorithms like RSA PSS This is also why Node has this caveat about ecdsa with SHA256 It is not that OpenSSL is missing this Node was using the wrong API As part of the 1 0 0 changes hash functions like EVP sha256 in OpenSSL are no longer are tied to signature algorithms and may be used with any key This means that RSA SHA256 in Node just means SHA256 Even before this patch replacing DSS1 with RSA SHA1 in test crypto binary default js worked fine Unfortunately the Node crypto createSign API is incompatible with EVP DigestVerify due to parameters and key being specified late which means it can only be used with signature algorithms which sign a pre hashed digest rather than something more complex Fortunately that is all of them right now though Node will need new APIs for Ed25519 in the future PR 11705 switched Node away from using EVP Sign but not to the new APIs In doing so it copied bits of EVP SignFinal but missed a critical check that prevents pkey pkey ptr from being downcast to the wrong pointer type That codepath is problematic for OpenSSL 1 1 0 and redundant note how the verify half does not have this Moreover using RSA SHA256 with RSA PSS does not make sense RSA SHA256 is the name of the sha256WithRSAEncryption OID used with PKCS 1 v1 5 not RSA PSS That RSA SHA256 works in place of SHA256 is the same legacy quirk of EVP Sign that allows it to be used with EC DSA Rather than all this always use the EVP PKEY sign codepath Everything that previously worked still works but more safely and consistently Update the documentation to call the parameter the hash function not the signature algorithm finishing a change that PR 11705 effectively did but not fully Thank you for your pull request Please provide a description above and review the requirements below Bug fixes and new features should include tests and possibly benchmarks Contributors guide Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x documentation is changed or added x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s Provide affected core subsystem s like doc cluster crypto etc crypto,,"davidben,davidben,davidben,jasnell,davidben,davidben,BridgeAR,davidben,BridgeAR,davidben,BridgeAR,davidben,davidben,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,BridgeAR",2017-08-24 23:05:53,2017-09-11 03:27:09

IS,Crash in Node v8 1 2,Version v8 1 2 Platform Windows 8 1 64 bit Subsystem This is the script which causes the issue I'm execution this script using node exe test js so no other arguments are passed The issue The Node js process exits immediatelly after entering the first loop without displaying any warnings or errors What is the expected behavior This script searches for the first unicode emoji character However because of Math random 42 20 it may close before such character is found However when run in Node js the process exits immediatelly after the thread enters the first loop No errors or warnings or anything is displayed The script is tested in Chrome and Firefox and seems to work It is also tested in older versions of Node js and works Details You can notice some irrelevant pieces of code For example there are a variable sumDigits which is a function but it is never used However if that line is removed the script works properly Also there is irrelevant 42 20 part after the Math random However if that is removed the script works properly It is probably a v8 issue What may cause the issue My opinion is that eval on the first line somehow causes the crash but I have no idea how because sumDigits is never called,,"maasencioh,mscdex,mscdex,targos,seishun,bnoordhuis",2017-08-29 08:23:34,2017-09-11 10:08:53

PR,http2 async wrap introduce AliasedBuffer class,This change introduces an AliasedBuffer class and updates async wrap and http2 to use this class A common technique to optimize performance is to create a native buffer and then map that native buffer to user space via JS array The runtime can efficiently write to the native buffer without having to route though JS and the values being written are accessible from user space While efficient this technique allows modifications to user space memory w out going through JS type system APIs effectively bypassing any monitoring the JS VM has in place to track program state modifications The result is that monitors have an incorrect view of program state The AliasedBuffer class provides a future placeholder where this technique can be used but writes can still be observed To achieve this the node chakra core fork will add in appropriate tracking logic in the AliasedBuffer is SetValue method Going forward this class can evolve to support more sophisticated mechanisms if necessary x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x tests and or benchmarks are included tests added happy to run benchmarks just lmk documentation is changed or added x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s async wrap http2,,"mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,jasnell,jasnell,jasnell,mike-kaufman,jasnell,jasnell,trevnorris,trevnorris,trevnorris,trevnorris,mike-kaufman,jasnell,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,trevnorris,trevnorris,trevnorris,trevnorris,trevnorris,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,trevnorris,addaleax,trevnorris,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,trevnorris,trevnorris,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,jasnell,mscdex,mike-kaufman,jasnell,jasnell,mike-kaufman,addaleax,mike-kaufman,jasnell,addaleax,jasnell,jasnell,trevnorris,mike-kaufman,mike-kaufman,jasnell,addaleax,jasnell,mike-kaufman,jasnell,addaleax",2017-08-29 15:42:15,2017-09-13 15:44:45

IS,http2 client browser refresh crashing the server,This is with version 8 5 0 of node I have a situation where as the browser window is closing or refreshing it sends a last ditch attempt to release locks that the user may hold There is an api function for this which when it has completed calls response end ' ' I have a convention that all api calls should return a valid json object even if its a null object I catch unhandled rejections and print the error stack along with what url is being processed at the time The url is a red herring its a call several milliseconds into the new browser window starting up but the error is real My server falls over with What I believe is happening is the api call gets through takes a while to make a database call to release the locks and then tries to send the response end by which time the original stream and maybe even the session have disappeared I would have expected from the new compatability api docs that request would have fired an 'aborted' event at some point before this happens but I log those and nothing happened Looking at the compat code I can see the error would not have thrown if a callback had been provided to response write but as is indicated in the stack this is called from response end where no callback is passed through Regardless of this issue I do have an on 'error' listener on the response and that was not fired either Should the error be sent there,,"apapirovski,jasnell,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,mcollina",2017-09-13 10:06:26,2017-09-18 14:23:06

PR,http2 adjust error emit in core add tests,This PR updates http2 core to need less bindings and closures when emitting various events instead it uses the already existing ability of process nextTick and setImmediate to pass through arguments Despite having to use a rest parameter this is actually faster than binding or creating a closure My understanding is that with V8 6 2 this code will only get faster Also there is a minor fix for the fact that incorrect headers passed to the various respond with file methods were not correctly exiting after an error and instead continued to run the rest of the function I adjusted the existing headers benchmark to use a few more of the affected functions and the benchmark result is below this is over 250 iterations for each node version Not a huge difference but probably still worthwhile The headers benchmark is the best for assessing these changes because it runs into these event emits on both the client and the server I only used nheaders at 0 because the other variations stress the wrong parts of the system that we do not care about I have also added tests to cover most of these emits throughout the code There are a few spots left uncovered but I will need to figure out a slightly different way of testing than just mocking the handle method to output error codes I do not think that should hold up this PR though as they were already not covered by tests Thanks for reviewing Thank you for your pull request Please provide a description above and review the requirements below Bug fixes and new features should include tests and possibly benchmarks Contributors guide Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x tests and or benchmarks are included x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s Provide affected core subsystem s like doc cluster crypto etc http2 test,,"apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,jasnell,apapirovski,jasnell,BridgeAR,apapirovski",2017-09-24 17:41:42,2017-10-01 23:14:46

PR,tls improve TLSSocket Server performance,While working on http2 I spent some time digging around tls and I noticed that there were a whole lot of unnecessary closures and function calls throughout I decided to go through and try to eliminate as many of them as possible Turns out some of these did not even need much changed such as all the handle events because the handle already knows which TLSSocket it belongs to I tried to limit the churn as much as possible but there definitely is some of it I have avoided making unnecessary variable adjustments from var to let const except where the line in question or related block was already changing I also limited all my changes to performance and kept all the logic the same While the existing tests cover a very solid amount of this module I did not want to potentially introduce bugs in uncovered edge cases It is a bit hard to get a good measure of performance for these changes as so much of this performance is being limited elsewhere but I created a basic benchmark for TLSSocket creation which clocked in at and do note that this is limited by the C and other code there is a note re JS specific numbers further down The tls connect benchmark was not much help because it seemed limited by my system is ability to allocate new sockets rather than the actual performance of the code I could not even run a reliable benchmark comparing master to master itself with 200 runs I got results anywhere from 10 to 10 with almost no certainty let alone my code to master I also used vegeta to hit a basic TLS server and ran a benchmark for what the max handled requests per second would be at full saturation With these changes I got a reliable 4 increase across a total of million requests or so Also running the node profiler on the new code indicates that the JS code throughout TLSSocket takes about 50 less time and the JS code within tlsConnectionListener takes about 35 less time this is across 40 runs of tls connect js and 10m session with vegeta It is a bit hard to run an actual benchmark on it though because so much of it is tied to other code I realize this is quite a lot to review so thanks for any and all feedback Let me know if there is anything I can do to make this more digestible Thank you for your pull request Please provide a description above and review the requirements below Bug fixes and new features should include tests and possibly benchmarks Contributors guide Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s Provide affected core subsystem s like doc cluster crypto etc tls,,"apapirovski,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,BridgeAR,apapirovski,mcollina,mcollina,mcollina,mcollina,mcollina,mcollina,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,mcollina,mcollina,apapirovski,apapirovski,mcollina,apapirovski,apapirovski,mcollina,apapirovski,mcollina,BridgeAR,apapirovski,mcollina,apapirovski,mscdex,apapirovski,refack,BridgeAR,apapirovski,jasnell,jasnell,mcollina,apapirovski,mcollina,apapirovski,apapirovski,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,MylesBorins,apapirovski,MylesBorins,mcollina,MylesBorins",2017-09-23 18:41:41,2017-10-02 02:35:11

PR,src do not add domain to promises in VM contexts,The promises are still tracked and their handlers will still execute in the correct domain The creation domain is now simply hidden in order to prevent objects from outside from leaking into a VM context Fixes and see more context at This is technically a breaking change as it removes a property from created Promise objects under certain circumstances However I would argue that this should be landed as semver patch for the following reasons This feature breaks the contract of the VM module that if one does not pass in any objects from the outside the VM context is fully independent In other words it can be a bug of security implications despite the fact that we advertise VM module as not a full sandbox which is duly noted both in documentation vm vm executing javascript and by in issuecomment 333084637 The core feature of domains preserving information across async boundaries is still available even after this PR Domain support for promises was introduced in v8 0 0 which means that most of the ecosystem probably have not yet started using the domain property on promises Even if they have the presence of domain on Promises is inconsistent at best Right now the property exists only if it was created in a running domain which means that modules that do not have control over domains i e pretty much all modules except for the very core of a program cannot depend on the presence of this property However once v8 x goes LTS this behavior will be near impossible to change Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x tests and or benchmarks are included x documentation is changed or added x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s Provide affected core subsystem s like doc cluster crypto etc src,,"TimothyGu,addaleax,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,addaleax,TimothyGu,addaleax,TimothyGu,MylesBorins,MylesBorins",2017-09-30 06:02:39,2017-10-04 19:28:17

IS,Deterministically generating a string from object,There are a few different contexts where it can be useful to generate a string representation of an object The basic idea is that the same in memory representation of the object should always yield the same string You may want to use an object as a cache key You may want to generate a MAC for an object for example for use with JSON Web Tokens You may want to store an object to disk or to the database in a way that it can be re created in memory later For each of these use cases a serialization function should generate the same string or Buffer for the same object Generating different strings could lead you to incorrectly conclude the object changed The most common serialization technique used for example by the node jsonwebtoken is to call JSON stringify However JSON stringify does not guarantee deterministic output The latest ECMA spec for JSON stringify says that it should produce the same order as Object keys which should produce the same order as for in which uses Object Enumerate to enumerate object keys Enumerate is a deprecated and b the specification contains this note note note sec ordinary object internal methods and internal slots enumerate The mechanics and order of enumerating the properties is not specified but must conform to the rules specified below It would be nice if there were any function in the standard library that could convert an object to a string in a deterministic way This could be solved in any of the following ways Declaring that Node is JSON stringify will always produce the same string output for the same object input JSON stringify is controlled by an ECMA specification and V8 so I'm not sure that this is feasible Adding a new API to either crypto or util that takes an Object as input and generates a string guaranteeing it will generate the same output across Node versions Documenting that some existing API for example Buffer from object util format fmt object with some format string will always generate the same string for the same object and different strings for different objects I guess there is some question of what the same means roughly I would think two objects that are equal as defined by something like Lodash is isEqual function should generate the same string and objects that fail an isEqual check should generate different strings,,"TimothyGu,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis",2017-09-26 20:02:09,2017-10-05 08:58:14

PR,http2 near full http1 compatibility add tests,As a preface this is a lot of changes but I had no way to separate them out into small chunks due to the order in which they happened I started with working on support for HEAD requests and other minor http2 tweaks but as I got the express on finished test suites to work I had to change a ton of that code and as a result it is hard for me to separate it out since some of these changes have broader effect on the compatibility layer With this PR we pass 100 of tests in express on finished that are applicable to http2 There are tests in on finished that do not apply re handling upgrade and there are 4 tests in express that use a 3rd party module that we can not do anything about because it uses http1 prototype directly Full or near full list of changes follows Add complete prop for Http2ServerRequest Add method setter since some user land modules use this Add socket and connection on Http2ServerResponse Add a proxy socket that is in reality referring to the Http2Stream for all the most commonly used aspects of the socket in http1 Major rework of writeHead write end addHeader and removeHeader A lot of user land modules including express rely on the fact that in http1 all write methods call writeHead if headers have not been written yet Add support for http1 style handling of HEAD requests expects end call and triggers callback even if writeHead already happened Dump data in Readable when kFinish runs if the user has not accessed it yet this is what h1 does No longer unset kStream and instead unset kResponse kRequest no longer emit an error event for the CANCEL rst code 8 this is done mostly for h1 compatibility but also because a lot of clients seem to use this to signify client requested abort similar to how you could just trigger shutdown with code 0 The code is still emitted on streamClosed if anyone wants to know Since the error emits on stream are not actionable in http2 it seems like this has very minor implications and it allows us to support the user code already out there much easier I could potentially just do some manipulation in my proxy socket instead but it really hampers its performance and as a result the performance of express on finished Separate commit that adds address related info on the session instead of needing to access the socket Performance has actually improved by about 5 with all of the changes in here even when accessing the socket despite the use of a Proxy Please let me know if I can provide more info for any of these changes It came a long way since I started this work cc Thank you for your pull request Please provide a description above and review the requirements below Bug fixes and new features should include tests and possibly benchmarks Contributors guide Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x tests and or benchmarks are included x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s Provide affected core subsystem s like doc cluster crypto etc http2 test,,"apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,jasnell,apapirovski,apapirovski,jasnell,apapirovski,mcollina,apapirovski,apapirovski,jasnell,benjamingr,mcollina",2017-09-30 18:53:04,2017-10-06 21:05:43

PR,module resolve and instantiate loader pipeline hooks,This PR provides an implementation of a hooking mechanism worked on with some early feedback from Usage The es module loading pipeline is hooked via a loader flag to Node which specifies a file containing a loader definition For example usage A loader that loads all files including js as es modules is provided at A loader that provides named exports for NodeJS builtin modules is provided at Motivation This work is built to follow principles of extensibility allowing users framework and platform developers for this feature to customize their own hooks for their use case needs The core ecosystem conventions for loading modules in NodeJS will remain the ones that NodeJS sets itself by the ecosystem popularity due to interop requirements The goal here though is that through having the ability for users to experiment with loader features will allow the most useful and popular features to potentially be merged back into NodeJS core to extend the ecosystem conventions So roughly the extensible manifesto thinking I believe enabling these use cases is important to avoid possible ecosystem fragmentation through other means The examples above show common use cases and these hooks are also sufficient to implement the package json module property resolution concept using a loader Architecture The hook architecture here is inspired by learnings from the WhatWG loader work while aiming to cut down the scope of hooking to a bare minimum API surface area as can be seen from the examples The loader itself is given control of module resolution of the form This API is designed to enable the above example use cases while ensuring that loader internals are kept private to ensure that what is hooked is only what is intended to be hooked For example none of ModuleWrap is exposed Feedback very welcome Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x tests and or benchmarks are included x documentation is changed or added x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s Provide affected core subsystem s like doc cluster crypto etc esmodules,,"guybedford,jasnell,jasnell,jasnell,jasnell,Fishrock123,Fishrock123,Fishrock123,Fishrock123,Fishrock123,Fishrock123,bmeck,bmeck,bmeck,guybedford,guybedford,guybedford,bmeck,bmeck,bmeck,TimothyGu,domenic,guybedford,bmeck,Fishrock123,bmeck,bmeck,guybedford,Fishrock123,guybedford,guybedford,Fishrock123,Fishrock123,guybedford,guybedford,targos,targos,targos,bcoe,guybedford,bcoe,bcoe,guybedford,jasnell,bmeck,domenic,guybedford,iarna,bcoe,bcoe,bmeck,bcoe,bmeck,guybedford,guybedford,Fishrock123,guybedford,Fishrock123,guybedford,guybedford,guybedford,BridgeAR,evanlucas,guybedford,Fishrock123,bmeck,bcoe,bmeck,Fishrock123,guybedford,bmeck,gibfahn,bmeck,guybedford,guybedford,gibfahn,bmeck,bmeck,targos,bmeck,bmeck,Trott,Trott,bcoe,Trott,Trott,refack,Trott",2017-09-17 10:29:56,2017-10-11 13:48:02

IS,add a node suffix to V8 is version number,About one year ago we tried to add the possibility on V8 to have a custom suffix appended to the version string This would allow us to apply patches to stable V8 versions without conflicting with the original version number and keep track of our own changes The idea is to define this suffix in common gypi example For example we can choose to use node X or node X and increment X every time we apply a non official patch to deps v8 The full version string would look like 6 1 534 42 node 12 Unfortunately the change failed to land at that time because of an issue with how V8 is updated in Chromium I changed the code a little bit this week and it should be good to go The CL has already been reviewed and accepted 690475 v8 and tsc please give your opinion on the approach If you are OK with it I will land the change in V8 and backport it here so we can have it on time for v9 0 0,,"targos,mcollina,addaleax,ofrobots,targos,targos",2017-09-30 12:31:31,2017-10-18 16:20:16

IS,Set NPM to use all CPU,Dear Dev Team I have a question if it is normal for NodeJS 6 6 on CentOS 7 to use only one CPU core for any npm command on 100 even if I have 22 cores It is getting very annoying that I have a 22 core server but whenever it comes to npm commands the process is very slow because it uses only one CPU and since the clock speed is only 1 7 Ghz it is not light speed Is there a setting that allows me to redirect more CPU to nodejs commands applications Regards Bert,,bnoordhuis,2017-10-25 07:47:27,2017-10-25 08:14:21

PR,test allow for different nsswitch conf settings,The motivation for this commit is that these two test fail on systems that have different Name Service Switch configuration settings A concrete example of this is when using Red Hat Enterprise Linux RHEL 7 If Name Service Switch is available on the operating system then it might be configured differently etc nsswitch conf If the system is configured with no dns the error code will be AI AGAIN but if there are more services after the dns entry for example some linux distributions skip a myhostname service by default which would still produce the ENOTFOUND error This commit suggests checking for either ENOTFOUND or EAI AGAIN to accommodate systems like the ones described above The references below indicate that others have run or are running into this aswell Refs Refs Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s Provide affected core subsystem s like doc cluster crypto etc test,,"danbev,danbev,danbev,danbev,danbev,danbev",2017-10-22 10:14:50,2017-10-25 09:18:56

IS,Exposing the logic behind require resolve via a public API,Node js does not expose any public API for resolving dependencies As a result there are many packages in the ecosystem that are trying to reimplement mimic Node is module resolution algorithm resolve resolve from eslint plugin import just to list some of them The big problem with these implementations is that they do not work the way Node is require resolve works For instance both resolve and resolve from were preserving symlinks by default I did PRs to both packages to fix this issue but they are just a drop in the ocean I work on pnpm a Node package manager that uses a symlinked node modules structure This node modules structure is Node js compatible when Node is executed w o the preserve symlinks flag but because of the many incorrect implementations of Node is module resolution algorithm pnpm is basically unusable with most of the popular frameworks toolings Exposing Node is resolution algorithm would allow experimenting with different node modules structures and tools frameworks would adjust because they would resolve dependencies correctly,,"cjihrig,bnoordhuis",2017-10-22 17:50:12,2017-10-25 13:17:26

PR,Inspector Track async stacks only when necessary,This is an alternative to It depends on a back port of an upstream fix included but solves the problem much more elegantly comprehensively With this change we do async stack tracking only when explicitly requested by the inspector client This avoids unnecessary overhead for clients that might not be interested in async stack traces In practical terms this means that we still get async stack tracking right from startup when inspect brk is used for debuggers that enable async stacks DevTools does this by default and I think WebStorm and others as well When using inspect we no longer enable async stack tracking by default The inspector client can request async stack tracking at the time of the connection Any async resources already created will not have stack tracking I believe this is the right behavior see 16180 Users needing async stack tracking right from startup can use inspect brk Fixes 16180 Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x X make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes X commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s Provide affected core subsystem s like doc cluster crypto etc deps v8 inspector cc v8 inspector CI V8 CI,,"ofrobots,targos,ofrobots,bnoordhuis,ofrobots,ofrobots,ofrobots,refack,ofrobots,refack,ofrobots,ofrobots,refack,ofrobots,refack,ofrobots,refack,ofrobots,ofrobots",2017-10-18 23:45:18,2017-10-29 16:41:58

PR,http2 fix several timeout related issues,This resolves a couple of issues around timeouts in http2 1 Upon start and stop of write unrefActive should be called both on stream and on session I can not really create a good test case for this because it is way too reliant on timers One can observe this by having a server receive a request have a timeout of 1000ms on the session and delay the stream response which has to last longer than 500ms by 500ms The session will timeout 500ms after the stream write starts instead of 1000ms 2 Long writes will always timeout because once the data is handed off to C JS loses all track of it This is basically the same issue as the one recently patched in net tls Solution is a bit different because tracking writeQueueSize in C is not quite reliable due to framing headers and what not Much like with tls net the solution is not super straightforward because we do not want to completely tank the performance of requests that are not likely to timeout To test locally you can use the following server A successful result would be 30000000 0 records in and take around 40s but it will stop after only 1s with current versions of node Thank you for your pull request Please provide a description above and review the requirements below Bug fixes and new features should include tests and possibly benchmarks Contributors guide Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x tests and or benchmarks are included x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s Provide affected core subsystem s like doc cluster crypto etc http2 test,,"apapirovski,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,apapirovski,addaleax,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,addaleax,apapirovski,apapirovski,addaleax,jasnell,addaleax,jasnell,addaleax,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,jasnell,jasnell,apapirovski,jasnell",2017-10-26 19:30:54,2017-10-29 17:02:31

IS,Error code extensibility,Version 8 6 0 Platform any Subsystem any Node JS now uses the Error code property and various NPM modules also use that property Some put in a string like Node some put in a number e g Tedious It would be very helpful for the community for Node JS to try to set a standard here for how to differentiate between errors using error codes I mean nothing more than adding a section to the Error documentation that explains how to safely add error codes for your module that wo not interfere with any future Node JS error codes naming convention To prevent conflicts between codes used in different libraries a naming convention would have to include something unique to the module the module name Node error codes have already been defined and changing them is a semver major so we would want the convention to allow for the error codes that already exist hierarchy Also handy would be the possibility of some form of hierarchy e g my module SQL ERROR UNIQUE INDEX VIOLATED This allows actions to be taken for all sql errors or just for unique index violations Of course lots of modules use a class prototype hierarchy to encode this but using the instanceof operator for error differentiation can be tricky After all NPM can install multiple versions of a module thereby introducing multiple versions of a prototype Also communicating errors e g from a web server to a client often loses the prototype edit I now use dots to separate the hierarchy components above instead of a colon since when you log an error to the console there will typically be a colon between the error name and message proposal Document in the Errors chapter of the NodeJS API documentation that the following naming convention for error codes is recommended 1 All system errors and Node errors will always start with ERR which is apparently already the convention 1 All third party errors should have the form module name error name where error name can be a colon separated list of elements,,"evanlucas,bnoordhuis",2017-10-06 09:13:18,2017-11-06 21:47:39

PR,Support both OpenSSL 1 1 0 and 1 0 2,WARNING This is a rather large change In a previous PR it was suggested that Node was uninterested in incremental changes for OpenSSL 1 1 0 support with the worry that OPENSSL VERSION NUMBER ifdefs in the code will appear as if you support 1 1 0 when you do not However doing it all in one commit is also not feasible as one cannot possibly review such a change I have instead attempted a middle ground where there is one PR but it is made up of many many individual commits It is recommended that you review each commit individually and not use Github is combined diff UI Let me know if you would like the branch presented differently Go back to separate PRs etc This was partially adapted from PR 8491 but fixes some issues with it This PR does not switch Node to OpenSSL 1 1 0 nor does it break support with OpenSSL 1 0 2 Two notes OpenSSL needs applied This means OpenSSL 1 1 0g or later which is not yet released Since it would otherwise compile but not work I have added a OPENSSL VERSION NUMBER check to catch this test http2 create client connect does not work I have fixed an issue with the test itself but it still does not pass in 1 1 0 The HTTP 2 code bypasses the usual JS afterWrite code which combined with some weird OpenSSL behaviors causes the error handling to be a little off It actually affects 1 0 2 just not on that particular test is input I will file a separate ticket for all that but since it affects 1 0 2 too I figure that should be separate to this PR I will put together a report with details later Additionally switching to OpenSSL 1 1 0 comes with a number of removals OpenSSL has documentation here x7 I have described what I did notice below Where it was feasible I added a change to retain compatibility in Node is API as much as possible I will let you all decide exactly which of those you wish to include For instance one could imagine adding 1 1 0 support so it does not bitrot but still shipping with 1 0 2 for a deprecation cycle and then switching to 1 1 0 with all the breakages that entails That would let you drop some of the commits in this branch DSS1 In OpenSSL 1 0 2 the digest name DSS1 was a DSA alias for SHA 1 part of the EVP Sign legacy This has been removed in OpenSSL 1 1 0 In crypto add compatibility logic for DSS1 and dss1 I have added a compatibility knob for it but it may be better to skip this commit and instead deprecate the name since there are other unavoidable removals anyway Weak crypto OpenSSL 1 1 0 disables a number of weak ciphers like RC4 or anonymous ciphers by default You can build OpenSSL with enable weak ssl ciphers if you wish to restore them If you do you probably want a deprecation cycle OpenSSL 1 1 0 also rejects RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits by default and other settings See SHA 0 SHA 0 was removed in OpenSSL 1 1 0 This is an insecure and virtually unused early variant of SHA 1 but Node did nominally expose it via crypto createHash isha' Short of adding a compatibility reimplementation of the hash I think this is an unavoidable removal in OpenSSL 1 1 0 tlsSocket getCipher version The version field returned by tlsSocket getCipher did not do what was documented in 1 0 2 and always returned the string TLSv1 SSLv3 I have retained that behavior in Node and fixed the documentation but you all may wish to go through a deprecation cycle with that field It is not useful anyway See the commit crypto hard code tlsSocket getCipher version for details Error messages Some of the errors OpenSSL emits are slightly differnent I had to fix a few strings in tests Dunno how much you care about this sort of behavior change ecdhCurve The ecdhCurve server setting in the TLS module is defined to disable ECDH This is a remnant of an implementation quirk in OpenSSL where it lacked curve negotiation logic That meant there exists an ECDH less state for OpenSSL servers separate from the cipher list Note no such mode exists on the client They fixed this and added this ecdh auto opt in knob in 1 0 2 In 1 1 0 this opt in knob was made always on Unfortunately Node exposed this state by setting ecdhCurve to false I have hacked it back in in the comment crypto fix setting ecdhCurve to false with OpenSSL 1 1 0 by appending to the user is cipher list Your call whether you wish to keep this Since everything in TLS without ECDHE is insecure anyway I would suggest taking a deprecation cycle to remove this instead and dropping the commit Ticket keys OpenSSL 1 0 2 used a 16 byte key name 16 byte AES 128 CBC key and 16 byte HMAC SHA256 key for session tickets OpenSSL 1 1 0 switches this to a 16 byte key name 32 byte AES 256 CBC key and 32 byte HMAC SHA256 key One can query the size of the ticket key with SSL CTX get tlsext ticket keys to avoid the hard coded 48 but that does not really solve the problem That ticket keys are 48 bytes are exposed in Node is public APIs In crypto emulate OpenSSL 1 0 x ticket scheme in 1 1 x I have implemented the callback to use the old scheme in OpenSSL 1 1 0 This works but you may wish to think about alternate APIs maybe expose a constant somewhere for the ticket key size that allow the ticket scheme to change SSL METHOD and protocol versions OpenSSL is old SSL METHODs are kind of a mess You had methods like TLSv1 1 client method which locked you to TLS 1 1 and only worked for clients Then you had methods like TLSv1 1 method which were exactly the same as TLSv1 1 client method except you could use them for either clients or server Then you had SSLv23 method which was actually version flexible and misnamed Then to configure versions you had toggles like SSL OP NO TLSv1 1 This is a mess In OpenSSL 1 1 0 things are much better SSLv23 method is renamed to TLS method and then you have APIs like SSL CTX set min proto version and SSL CTX set max proto version TLS client method and TLS server method sadly still exist and are approximately as pointless as they always were Unfortunately Node is APIs thoroughly expose this and has the user specify the string name of the method to use rather than min max version configurations OpenSSL 1 1 0 retains the old APIs but marks them as deprecated so this still works but you have a lot oc compile warnings I have not attempted to remove the deprecated APIs in this branch as I think you all need a better API first My suggestion 1 Deprecate the secureProtocol option 2 Introduce option like perhaps minVersion and maxVersion 3 Once secureProtocol is completely removed stop using the version locked methods and

PR,Make tests engine agnostic,We treat error message changes as breaking changes and therefore often test for exact error messages However this only applies to errors generated by Node js core For errors generated by V8 the TSC has determined that we do not consider it a breaking change when an error message changes We have a relatively easy way to find these errors in our tests because ChakraCore will often usually almost always need to modify such tests to match their error messages This PR changes several tests that node chakracore needed to modify due to the overzealous error message checking much of which I may have been responsible for either directly or indirectly but hey we all get to learn from our mistakes There are still more tests to be done but this is a good start and reaction to this will inform the approach in the rest of the tests chakracore testing Thank you for your pull request Please provide a description above and review the requirements below Bug fixes and new features should include tests and possibly benchmarks Contributors guide Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s Provide affected core subsystem s like doc cluster crypto etc test,,"Trott,targos,refack,lpinca,jasnell,jasnell,gibfahn,Trott,Trott,refack,Trott,gireeshpunathil,joyeecheung,Trott,Trott,Trott,jasnell,MylesBorins",2017-10-18 00:05:54,2017-11-12 01:46:08

PR,repl support top level await,This PR depends upon and is rebased on top of 16392 This PR endeavors to fix following the footsteps of Google Chrome Algorithmically it uses much of the same strategies as the Chromium CL namely using a JS parser Acorn and then transforming the to be executed source code based on that AST In fact the AST node visitors are pretty much a direct port of DevTools code from DevTools' homebrew AST walker to one supplied by Acorn Unlike the usual parse transform serialize pipeline i e the Babel way however I decided to adopt the Bubl way which is to mutate the source code directly based on the locations in the AST While by design this approach is more fragile than a full AST serialization it is 1 much faster 2 requires less bundled code 3 the approach used by Chrome DevTools and 4 just enough for this specific use case because we know transformed code does not need to be transformed again thereafter A huge focus of and a must have is support for await expressions used in variable declarations and assignments Like DevTools this PR supports variable declarations by transforming them into assignments Take While this works well for var it does not for top level let and const let and const still work as expected in blocks which will lose their lexical specialness or constantness with this approach However I simply can not think of any good way to support top level let and const fully Note DevTools has the same problem try const a await Promise resolve 1 back to back multiple times If you have got an idea please comment The implementation in this PR is fully complete with the above caveat though a comment or two can perhaps be added in the right places However tests still need to be added especially around the SIGINT handling part which turned out to be much more complex than the actual source transformation For source code transformation Chromium has two very comprehensive sets of tests that we can borrow Anyway please test and report back how it works Many thanks to for his DevTools implementation would not have been able to finish this without his work cc Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x tests and or benchmarks are included documentation is changed or added x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s Provide affected core subsystem s like doc cluster crypto etc repl readline deps,,"TimothyGu,jasnell,TimothyGu,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis,mscdex,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,bnoordhuis,benjamingr,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,addaleax,TimothyGu,benjamingr,princejwesley,TimothyGu,princejwesley,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,princejwesley,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,jasnell,jasnell,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,targos,mscdex,TimothyGu,mscdex,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,TimothyGu,Fishrock123,devsnek,MylesBorins,gibfahn,bmeck,gibfahn,jasnell,jasnell,Trott,bmeck,jasnell,benjamingr,mcollina,bmeck,cjihrig,TimothyGu,bmeck,bmeck,bmeck,bmeck",2017-09-23 07:44:12,2017-11-16 23:43:21

PR,timers cross JS C border less frequently for setImmediate,This removes the process needImmediateCallback property and its semantics of having a 1 0 switch that tells C whether immediates are currently scheduled Instead a counter keeping track of all immediates is created that can be increased on setImmediate or decreased when an immediate is run or cleared This is faster because rather than writing reading a C getter this operation can be performed as a direct memory read write via a typed array The only C call that is left to make is activating the native handles upon creation of the first Immediate after the queue is empty One other good side effect is that immediate destroyed now reliably tells whether an immediate is still scheduled to run or not Also as a nice extra this should make it easier to implement an internal variant of setImmediate for C that piggybacks off the same mechanism which should be useful at least for async hooks and HTTP 2 cc so you re aware of this last thing Benchmark results node benchmark compare js new node old node master 1b093cb93df0 runs 10 filter immediate timers Rscript benchmark compare R 00 08 53 100 4 4 files 20 20 runs 1 1 configs Done improvement confidence p value timers immediate js type breadth thousands 2000 25 61 1 432301e 03 timers immediate js type breadth1 thousands 2000 7 66 1 320233e 01 timers immediate js type breadth4 thousands 2000 4 61 5 669053e 01 timers immediate js type clear thousands 2000 311 40 3 896291e 07 timers immediate js type depth thousands 2000 17 54 9 755389e 03 timers immediate js type depth1 thousands 2000 17 09 7 176229e 04 timers set immediate breadth args js millions 5 10 63 4 250034e 02 timers set immediate breadth js millions 10 20 62 9 150439e 07 timers set immediate depth args js millions 10 17 97 6 819135e 10 Thank you for your pull request Please provide a description above and review the requirements below Bug fixes and new features should include tests and possibly benchmarks Contributors guide Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s timers,,"addaleax,refack,refack,refack,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,bnoordhuis,addaleax,addaleax,Fishrock123,Trott,addaleax,addaleax,MylesBorins,gibfahn",2017-11-16 00:12:43,2017-11-18 00:51:24

IS,Checkpoint and Restore,Hi I was reading through is proposal in 17058 and started wondering if this could be used to checkpoint restore a running node program I understand that a process is more than just the isolate and contexts i e there are OS level resources like file descriptors sockets etc that are not serializable But assuming that it would be acceptable to lose that part of the state Is this something that is currently possible would this be enabled or facilitated by the 17058 proposal I was picturing something like send a signal to a running node js process i e kill USR2 3049 and cause it to wait until the current callstack is finished serialize the state into a file and exit Later the same program could be restored by providing the file to a new process Of course any file network IO would have to be manually restored at this point Basically something like CRIU but specifically for node js which could make it potentially faster and space efficient,,refack,2017-11-17 19:42:01,2017-11-18 18:52:18

IS,Proposal provide a straight forward approach for collecting coverage via Chrome is Profiler,The Problem I have been having an ongoing discussion with and a few folks working on the V8 project schuay about how to move istanbul towards using v8 is built in coverage The biggest blocker tracked in the v8 issue tracker here is that we need a way to start Node with detailed coverage enabled can speak better to the specifics but as I understand it code needs to be put through a preprocessing step that introduces counters currently we are only able to collect function level coverage There are a few other blockers that I will also outline in this issue Collecting Detailed Coverage x proposes introducing a v8 flag that could be passed to Node when starting and would run inspector with detailed reporting enabled does this mean that we would need to stat Node js with inspector or could we still enable this post hoc Other Challenges There are a few other technical challenges that will need to be addressed to make the switch over to v8 is test coverage x if an application exits using process exit or by throwing an exception it is hard to capture this event and output the coverage information since talking to the inspector is socket is asynchronous One option might be using spawnSync within process exit but this currently has bugs x v8 is coverage output is significantly different than Itanbul is coverage json format we will need to write something that translates between the formats Why this is super cool transpilation to add coverage counters is complex and error prone it would be neat to have this happen at the v8 level code transpiled for test coverage runs significantly slower than the code prior to transpilation I'm betting collecting coverage directly from v8 will be fast although the subprocess shenanigans might add some overhead this would give us a way to collect coverage for mjs module files which is currently not possible since the new module system does not execute require extensions,,"bcoe,bcoe,bcoe,ak239,bcoe,bcoe",2017-10-26 21:31:39,2017-11-22 18:20:42

IS,crypto Better documentation for cases where peer is public key is invalid,Version 6 11 3 Platform Linux Subsystem crypto The documentation for ecdh computeSecret crypto ecdh computesecret otherpublickey inputencoding outputencoding does not discuss what happens when the other public key does not lie on the curve It just states that either a string with the given encoding or a Buffer will be returned For other methods in the same class there are explicit documentation that these throws an error if for example the input is not valid for this curve but not on this one If the own private key is static or not re generated in each exchange there are attacks that recover the private key So all implementers need to handle this case as part of implementing a protocol where ECDH is used by validating the provided public key and gracefully abort if the point is invalid Using prime256v1 as an example a first attempt might be to simply check that the buffer length of the input public key is 65 and the first byte is 0x04 But this is not enough since the point must also be checked against the curve equation Since bignums are needed for this it is non trivial to do this directly before the call and one must rely on the library handling this Thankfully the actual implementation throws a generic error with the string Failed to translate Buffer to a EC POINT at least when I test it with prime256v1 I was hoping for a more catchable friendly error at least having a documented type or error code so it is easily distinguished to other errors As far as my brain goes I cannot find a single use case where one would not also want to check for this error since it is not a programmer error but always a possible user input error Since people are generally not aware how to use crypto it is extremely important that the APIs are clear easy to use and no mistakes are possible So I was googling around a bit for createECDH computeSecret and found some code examples and tutorials None of them handled this case or did not even bring up the possibility that an attacker might give an incorrect public key The only case I found testing this was the official test file Just guessing but I'm pretty sure there is a bunch of production systems that will crash if one gives an incorrect public key And when the programmer then checks the crash log generated I'm not sure he would even know what Failed to translate Buffer to a EC POINT means My proposal is to first change the code to use some kind of typed error so it can be easily identified for this specific case and then update the documentation to catch this error in the example code as well as document in the computeSecret method how the invalid point error is reported The example currently only uses assert strictEqual to confirm that the two values are equal,,"bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis,tniessen,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis",2017-10-30 21:33:11,2017-12-01 20:20:23

IS,Node js HTTP Parser not handling UTF 8 encoded HTTP header values,Hi I have encountered an issue regarding the way HTTP header values are decoded The HTTP Parser project might be a better place to post this issue to but I thought I would post here first Currently it would seem that Node js is decoding HTTP header values as US ASCII ASCII 7 This becomes an issue now that browsers and servers started supporting UTF 8 values as well A simple example would be a website that has a URL who redirects to a non percent encoded UTF 8 URL e g The first log will produce Location f b r there are invisible characters next to the is The second log will produce Location f b r which is the correct and expected result In this example to follow the redirect you would need to first instantiate a buffer in 'binary' encoding and then stringify it to it is 'utf8' representation The original RFC2616 that defined HTTP seemed to allow for any byte value with a few restrictions on control characters TEXT any OCTET except CTLs but including LWS cf section 3 2 6 cf section 2 2 The follow up update to HTTP RFC7230 seems to change that and restrict them to US ASCII ASCII 7 Non US ASCII content in header fields and the reason phrase has been obsoleted and made opaque the TEXT rule was removed Section 3 2 6 cf appendix A 2 I would expect most Node js HTTP clients to thus fail on the example I provided above Since browsers seems to support it and servers started sending it I have seen examples in the wild I think we can say that it has become a de facto standard and that it would be nice if either Node js core or HTTP Parser would support reading HTTP header values as UTF 8 by default Version Node js v6 x and v8 x Platform OSX Darwin Kernel Version 15 6 0 Subsystem http http parser,,"apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,jasnell,apapirovski",2017-11-29 17:06:52,2017-12-06 16:23:56

PR,Refactor async hooks initTriggerId,The first commit just renames initTriggerId to defaultTriggerAsyncId I think default is much more descriptive and we try to never use just id in async hooks but instead asyncId The second commit changes the magic value from 0 to 1 This is because 0 in the executionAsyncId context refers to a missing context while 0 in defaultTriggerAsyncId previously meant default context This allows the defaultTriggerAsyncId to mean missing context too The third commit is the main change It changes defaultTriggerAsyncId from being set by the setter and reset by the getter to instead have defaultTriggerAsyncId be bound to a scope The getter then does not change the value This is much more intuitive than getters mutating its own value This is actually related to the work done by in but this is a much more complete version of that Note All this is internal logic However in node v8 x and v9 x the initTriggerId is unfortunately exported although deprecated so properly we need to do a manual backport for those versions edit Oh the entire motivation behind this is that I want to improve some of our set triggerAsyncId s However in those cases it is not transparent if a new handle is always created thus the kDefaultTriggerAsyncId value might leak Binding kDefaultTriggerAsyncId to a scope prevents a leak Checklist x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x tests and or benchmarks are included x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s async hooks,,"AndreasMadsen,mcollina,mcollina,mcollina,AndreasMadsen,Fishrock123,AndreasMadsen,AndreasMadsen,AndreasMadsen,AndreasMadsen,mcollina,AndreasMadsen,AndreasMadsen,AndreasMadsen,AndreasMadsen,AndreasMadsen,AndreasMadsen",2017-11-23 11:00:51,2017-12-19 17:36:21

IS,RFC Updating object stringifying in v8 error messages,Hi Node js community I did some work recently in response to a bug filed about Symbol toStringTag not being used if a class inherited a null prototype 820292 of course in reality Symbol toStringTag was not used at all in the case the bug mentioned due to being an accessor property but still This CL would take the render constructor name path in more most cases whether the stringified object is not a function and is not an Error or does not have the same toString method as error and does not have a usable Symbol toStringTag data property Making this change results in some other effects for instance Proxies no longer look like object Object but instead tend to render as Proxy I also feel that it would be helpful for developers to report more information for proxies for instance also providing some information about the target object However this is a bit of an information leak and makes membranes a little bit invisible This is not done in the current CL but maybe it is something that would be worth tacking on Something like Proxy MyFancyFrameworkClass or something So I wanted to get some feedback from Node core and Node users before landing any of these changes upstream What would you think about making Proxy objects more clearly Proxies How much pain would the rest of the CL cause in general with respect to rendering the constructor derived string Are people doing weird things like parsing error messages or something,,"TimothyGu,TimothyGu",2017-12-14 23:59:10,2017-12-20 03:54:34

IS,add off as an alias for removeListener,Hello I would like to open an issue to advocate for adding an off method to EventEmitter as an alias of removeListener to parallel the existing on alias for addListener I know that this has been opened a few times in the past on old node js and on io js but many of the issues were a long time ago the landscape has converged a lot more on the off method since then and I would like to argue it once more with a well researched issue Thank you This addition would reduce the existing UX confusion that results from missing the very popular and commonly implemented parallel method to on It would provide a nice UX improvement by giving the listener removal use case its own terse method And it would help to improve interoperability with other very common event emitter libraries in node js and in the larger Javascript world Popular Libraries The on off method combination is very popular and it is used by some of the most popular libraries jQuery Zepto js Backbone js Events off Ember js Next js L21 Vue js vm off Atom L140 It is even exposed by popular node js libraries too like Socket io and Primus which choose to bundle their own event emitters with the off method Having it in these very popular libraries has contributed over time to people coming to expect off as the parallel method to on Not having it in node js creates confusion links to this coming up and reduces interoperability with other libraries Existing Emitters Further if you look at user land event emitter libraries in NPM every single one with over 1 million downloads per month implements the off method component emitter 14 5m downloads month Used by libraries like superagent socket io analytics js eventemitter3 8 4m downloads month Used by libraries like primus http proxy quill reflux eventemitter2 4 1m downloads month Used by libraries like pm2 grunt tiny emitter 1 3m downloads month Used by libraries like mathjs clipboard es6 map es6 set Even I was a little surprised that it was this popular It is so commonplace that not a single emitter library above 1 million downloads a month does not implement off Which results in many many other popular node js libraries exposing off in their own emitters and inherited classes That does not even include the many other event emitter popular libraries that have implemented off as well like wolfy87 eventemitter event lite co events event pubsub component emitter2 event emitter es6 Or other libraries like p event that handle the off method as a first class property of emitters for compatibility since so many people use it There are even libraries like nee off emitter mixin L61 or events off which have been created to add in the off method to existing event emitters that have not implemented it UX Confusion As you can see from above the on off pattern is very popular It is intuitive it has parallel structure and it is very terse which is nice since it is so often used and mixed in to other APIs But right now node js only implements the on method of the duo which leads to confusion from anyone who is used these other popular libraries Confusion like in this StackOverflow question Question How does one turn off the callback to prevent further on message callbacks There happens to be no off method I have to update the callback with a new one and it appears that all the old callbacks are being triggered as well Answer Why they added on as an alias but did not add off as an alias too I do not really know seems logical to me This kind of confusion does not only happen in the node js world You can see the same confusion in other libraries that implement on without the off parallel like in Angular To people who are trying to avoid the confusion in their own codebase they actually end up having to stop using the on method because it is so easy to forget that off does not exist as its parallel like these folks did Since this is easy to miss would you mind changing our on s to addListener so we are not tempted to off elsewhere Not having this parallel even leads to some weird differences between the browser and node environments For example Socket io instances have the off method client side but do not have it server side because the node js core EventEmitter does not implement it Previous Issues This issue has been brought up a few different times before But I think a decent amount has changed since then specifically the amount of other big libraries that have implemented the same pattern and the amount of userland support for the on off combination Here are some of the old arguments against adding off Off is not the parallel One of the arguments against using off was that the word off in English is not always parallel to on It was once pointed out that on could have an antonym of under too But I think this is super pedantic and does not actually hold that much water All of the existing support for on off as a pair and the StackOverflow questions that prove people immediately jump to off as the antonym prove this And at this point the amount of support for the combination is only further reinforcing this assumption which leads to people getting confused It is a pretty common pattern in other event related libraries EventEmitter2 and jQuery Zepto being the biggest I can think of Coming from client side I tried off first and when it did not work had to go consult the docs to find removeListener If you really do want to get into the weeds there there are arguments in favor of it being parallel like For example I might see an event emitter while not as a light switch as a switch on a walkie talkie where when on i hear things that come in on the channel but when i want to stop listening i turn it off There is many kinds of on off switches so I'm sure we can anecdotally come up with a bunch that do and a bunch that do not make sense as metaphors for event emitters but I do not see how that is convincing or valuable in either direction But I think and agreed that this descends into overly pedantic discussions Instead the vast amount of support for on off as a combination should prove already that it makes sense to a lot of people and is widely liked Not only that but if you want an equally not that useful argument if you lookup on on thesaurus com the only antonym that even shows up is off smile Aliases are bad Another of the arguments against it was that aliases are bad and that on should be removed instead of adding off But this is obviously not a solution There are so many dependencies on on that it is not going to be removed and it should not be People like the terseness of on a lot and would appreciate the same terseness in off For proof just look at the node js documentation Even though on is technically the alias and not the canonical method name almost all every single code snippet in the node js docs uses on instead of addListener that is because people appreciate the terseness it gives you Removing is rare Another argument that was brought up against off is that using removeListener is rare so it does not merit having an alias I think this is not valid on two counts First in the case of a use case where two methods have a very clear parallel I do not think it makes sense to omit one of the methods in the pair just because it is used slightly less The pair should be treated as a single feature If the alias for on is necessary which I think it is given its broad usage then the alias for off should be paired with it That is how well designed APIs accommodate users with a good UX Otherwise you set people up for an expectation that is not met Currently there is a nice pairing of addListener removeListener on exists as an alias for addListener but there is not a companion to on in the API so it is asymmetric off is the word that objectively based on library usage pairs best with on So I think it makes sense to add off as an alias to removeListener Second although using off may be less common for the node js core APIs because you are often setting up listeners for the duration of the process one of the main purposes of EventEmitter is to be inherited from by userland libraries And at that point I do not think we should assume the same usage patterns as for the core APIs It is very possible there are libraries like Socket io or browser use cases like unmounting components that use off much more frequently It is no longer reasonable to force the same usage pattern on everyone else especially for something this simple Adding this alias would also be handy in Socket io which inherits from EventEmitter Previous PR The good news is actually that there is already a pull request for this that we can just re open if we decide it is something that should be added Obviously I think it is smile And as you can see it is pretty minimal So I would like to propose that the existing PR be reopened and merged or we can resubmit a new one if it conflicts too much with the current codebase That is it Thank you for reading this far I would love to hear what you think in the comments If anyone else has more examples to add to any of the lists please let me know

IS,Tracking issue Converting tests to use Countdown,One possible set of tasks that I can suggest for new contributors who are bit more confident in their Node js skills would be converting tests to use the new common countdown utility module For instance if you take a look at you will see that there is a remaining counter L19 The test then counts down remaining before closing the server There are quite a large number of tests in our suite that perform similar actions in ways that are rather inconsistent The common countdown utility was designed to bring some consistency there The way the Countdown utility works is straightforward I know that there are quite a few of the http2 tests that can benefit from this along with a bunch of other http and https tests These tasks would be for folks who are a bit more comfortable with their Node js skills There are many tests in the suite that could be modified to use this new utility However rather than modifying them all at once if a new contributor wishes to take this on please one change one or two at a time leaving other tests for other contributors to pick up on Just reference this tracking issue in the commit PR so that we can keep track,,"jasnell,Bamieh,jasnell,joyeecheung,Bamieh,Bamieh,mithunsasidharan,mithunsasidharan,mithunsasidharan,maclover7",2017-11-21 03:58:25,2017-12-30 10:42:29

PR,tls simplify write mechanism,tls refactor write queues away The TLS implementation previously had two separate queues for WriteWrap instances one for currently active and one for finishing writes i e where the encrypted output is being written to the underlying socket However the streams implementation in Node doesn t allow for more than one write to be active at a time effectively the only possible states were that No write was active The first write queue had one item the second one was empty Only the second write queue had one item the first one was empty To reduce overhead and implementation complexity remove these queues and instead store a single WriteWrap pointer and keep track of whether its write callback should be called on the next invocation of InvokeQueued or not which is what being in the second queue previously effected tls remove cleartext input data queue The TLS implementation previously kept a separate buffer for incoming pieces of data into which buffers were copied before they were up for writing This removes this buffer and replaces it with a simple list of uv buf t s The previous implementation copied all incoming data into that buffer both allocating new storage and wasting time with copy operations Node s streams net implementation already has to make sure that the allocated memory stays fresh until the write is finished since that is what libuv streams rely on anyway The fact that a separate kind of buffer crypto NodeBIO was used was confusing These BIO instances are only used to communicate with openssl s streams system otherwise whereas this one was purely for internal memory management The name clear in was not very helpful Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s tls,,"addaleax,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis,TimothyGu,addaleax,jasnell,addaleax,apapirovski,addaleax,apapirovski,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,MylesBorins,addaleax",2017-12-27 19:10:44,2018-01-07 21:36:34

IS,We need a way to create an Http2Session from a socket,While building fetch h2 and when discussing with node fetch and while participating in 14671 I realize that we need this in Node js a protocol agnostic connect to a TLS enabled web server and let the ALPN handshake allow for both h2 and http 1 1 Without this we wo not be able to connect to an https server without knowing in beforehand if that server wants to or even can speak HTTP 1 1 or HTTP 2 I'm thinking of something like tls handoverConnect which does not take application level http arguments path headers etc it just connects and returns through a callback likely the protocol http 1 1 or h2 and a corresponding session A question is what the session data is In case of HTTP 2 it should be an Http2Session but for HTTP 1 1 it must be something where the user can perform the request and it should probably be integrated with Agents There is unfortunately an inheritance jungle in the design of these old functions like https request where ip tcp application level options are merged into one blob but the https 1 1 session here let is call it Http1SessionProxy should be something that looks like the http module in how it has a request function with the tcp ip level options removed Let is say this feature belongs in tls which I think it does In this example perhaps an Agent could be passed in the connectOpts so that if the session turns out to be HTTP 1 1 the connection will be added to this agent and by default the global Agent is used just like traditional http s request Any thoughts on this I guess it is a good time to look into this now as the http2 module is being tested in the wild but before it is stable,,"addaleax,addaleax,apapirovski,apapirovski,addaleax,jasnell,addaleax,jasnell,addaleax,apapirovski,addaleax,apapirovski,jasnell,apapirovski,jasnell",2017-10-17 12:14:30,2018-01-08 19:43:27

IS,Remove async hooks setTrigger API,Version master 016d81ceec2e0836eedd27c797c1aebd045a8479 Platform all Subsystem async hooks As I mentioned a few months ago I'm not comfortable exposing the low level async hooks JS API In the documentation PR we agreed to keep the low level JS API undocumented Some time have now passed and I think we are in a better position to discuss this The low level JS API is quite large thus I would like to separate the discussion into a discussion about setInitTriggerId and triggerIdScope async hookstriggeridscopetriggerid callback this edit a discussion about runInAsyncIdScope a discussion about newUid async hooksnewid emitInit async hooksemitinitid type triggerid resource emitBefore async hooksemitbeforeid triggerid emitAfter async hooksemitafterid and emitDestroy async hooksemitdestroyid edit there is some overlap between emitInit and setInitTriggerId in terms of initTriggerId Hopefully that wo not be an issue As I personally believe setInitTriggerId and triggerIdScope are the most questionable I would like to discuss those first Background async hooks uses a global state called async uid fields kInitTriggerId to set the triggerAsyncId of the soon to be constructed handle object 1 2 It has been mentioned eariler by that a better solution is wanted To set the async uid fields kInitTriggerId field from JavaScript there are two methods setInitTriggerId and triggerIdScope setInitTriggerId sets the async uid fields kInitTriggerId directly and is used in a single case in node core L295 If initTriggerId is not called after when creating the handle object this will have unintended side effects for the next handle object triggerIdScope is a more safe version of setInitTriggerId that creates a temporary scope outside said scope the async uid fields kInitTriggerId value is not modified This is not used anywere in node core Note This issue is about removing setInitTriggerId and triggerIdScope as a public API Not removing async uid fields kInitTriggerId itself that may come at later time Issues setInitTriggerId is extremely sensitive and wrong use can have unintended side effects Consider Such side effect may be obvious for us but I do not want to tell the user that console log can have unintended side effects Handle creation may change How many handles and the exact timing of this is not something we test I thus think it is reasonable to believe that this is something that will cause an unintended issue in the future Possibly during a semver patch update Note in all of these cases the handle creation and setting the initTriggerId may happen in two separate modules Solution We remove triggerIdScope We move setInitTriggerId to require 'internal async hooks js' The user should specify the triggerAsyncId directly in AsyncResource or emitInit The API already allows for this Note We may want to just deprecate the API in node 8 and remove it in a future version cc async hooks,,"AndreasMadsen,refack,AndreasMadsen,refack,refack,AndreasMadsen,refack,refack,AndreasMadsen,refack,AndreasMadsen,refack,trevnorris,AndreasMadsen,trevnorris,AndreasMadsen,trevnorris,AndreasMadsen,trevnorris,trevnorris,AndreasMadsen,trevnorris,AndreasMadsen,trevnorris,AndreasMadsen,trevnorris,AndreasMadsen,trevnorris,AndreasMadsen,trevnorris,AndreasMadsen,trevnorris,AndreasMadsen,AndreasMadsen",2017-07-14 19:49:42,2018-01-10 20:36:40
