IS,CONTRIBUTING md improvements,Version n a Platform n a Subsystem doc A problem with our CONTRIBUTING md is that it is very long and is often needlessly wordy Most people who are reading the doc are probably clicking through to it from the interface where they are opening a pull request or an issue In other words they are just about to do something That is a terrible time to put a super long document in front of them Ideally it would be a short document with just what people need Unfortunately that can be in tension with other purposes uses of CONTRIBUTING md such as to advertise our values and be welcoming So removing content might hit objections I had intended to go through and make it more concise in a piecemeal fashion without eliminating content See for example But then hellip I went to open a pull request in ESLint and came across this magnificent example of a CONTRIBUTING md Nice and short but links out to the things you need to know If you are opening a bug report it does not put hundreds of words about change requests in front of you That sort of thing So if someone wants to try to re organize our CONTRIBUTING md to be more like that one I would be Necessary caveat There are 106 other Collaborators on Node js and they are likely to have opinions too and their opinions may contradict mine or each other is Doc changes are hard enough as is but do be prepared for the too many cooks problem Do not get discouraged,,"Trott,joyeecheung",2017-12-23 17:37:59,2018-01-23 19:25:42

IS,meta about the collaborator nomination process,The current practice of promoting a contributor to a collaborators is somewhat like this 1 A TSC member opens an issue nominating a contributor or multiple of them usually posting links to their contributions and some more explanations Other people sometimes not a TSC member might nominate other contributors in that thread via a reply The nominees is usually asked if they want to be nominated in advance but it is not always done 2 Collaborators including TSC members express their opinions in the thread either by explicitly saying 1 to a specific contributor or by using emojis in a unorganized way They might also proposes some preconditions for someone to be onboarded e g wait until a PR lands 3 We wait for a weeks or longer if there are no objections and the proposed preconditions if any are met we start to onboard the nominees Only TSC member can onboard collaborators because they are the people who have admin access to the collaborators team The current way of doing things works but there are a few issues 1 The nominee might not feel really endorsed if the nomination is done in a reply where there could be multiple nominations and the reactions are expressed via emojis that are not related to any specific individuals in that reply 2 According to our documented governance model collaborators technically a collaborator needs to be nominated by TSC members but in practice some nominations done by non TSC collaborators went through while some needed to be redone by a TSC member We should either update the documentation to allow collaborators to nominate other collaborators or stick to what is documented 3 Nominees are not always asked prior to the nomination and I do not think we do private discussions prior to the public nominations It could get awkward if the nominee do not wish to have commit access or if someone express objections in public during the nomination process 4 We do not have a specific team of people doing onboarding I think it is usually done by when he finds the time so it might take a long time to get someone onboard after the nomination So in this thread I hope we could discuss 1 Who can nominate a collaborator Does it have to be done by a TSC member Collaborators can always ask a TSC member to do that though Or they can use the private discussion to notify the TSC see 3 2 Who can vote on the nomination I believe in practice it is the collaborators but that does not seem to be documented in GOVERNANCE md 3 What needs to be done prior to the nomination I think whoever wanting to nominate a collaborator should ask for the the nominees' opinion before making the nomination and we should probably discuss in private about it in case there are any objections concerns or preconditions maybe using the private Github team discussion 4 What should a nomination look like Personally I think separate replies dedicated to different nominees in a thread is probably enough but the approvals need to be more explicit to make the nominees feel welcomed At least we can leave something like if you are 1 to this nomination in each reply There should be a summary about their contributions and how long they have been involved not necessarily limited to the core repo though Also worth posting links like githubid to give readers a view of their contributions We should make a template for this and put that into a repo maybe here or nodejs admin We could also write a script that grabs the necessary data and generates a summary that can be worked on 5 How long should the nomination process take In practice I think it is about 1 2 weeks but since there are not enough people onboarding the nominees it usually takes longer 6 Who are responsible for onboarding people If the nomination is done by a TSC member then at least that person should be responsible but other TSC members could be more suitable considering timezones personal schedules and relationships Since it is done by the TSC members we can coordinate the work in the TSC mailing list or TSC meetings but I do not think it is usually done that way I plan to open a PR updating the documentation when we work out the details mentioned above,,"joyeecheung,Trott,Trott,devsnek,jasnell,jasnell,Trott,Trott,joyeecheung,MylesBorins,addaleax,jasnell,benjamingr,joyeecheung,jasnell,joyeecheung,joyeecheung,mcollina,joyeecheung,joyeecheung,tniessen,joyeecheung,mhdawson,Tiriel,joyeecheung,joyeecheung,joyeecheung",2018-01-10 21:59:42,2018-01-24 10:43:26

PR,esm Implement package json esm true flag for ES modules in js files,As previous proposed and discussed at this implements a package json lookup process for the module format so that adding esm true to the package json enables js files as ES modules There has been some discussion as well here as to whether this property should be a string to allow for extensibility in future which is also still ongoing The ideal workflow imagined would be one where the package manager init process itself adds this into the package json so that it becomes an invisible part of the authoring process not completely dissimilar to the doctype in html The cost of this approach is loading the base level package json for all module loads instead of just for mains The argument here is that there is already a lot of statting in the module lookup process and since this shares the package json cache with the mains it adds around one extra stat on average for subfolder package lookups per package loaded Compare to adding mjs which has added an extra stat per lookup path checked an order of magnitude more in cost here The benefit of this approach is end users never need to worry about the authoring format of a package they are importing build tools and bundlers wo not need to adapt to a separate linking mechanism for CommonJS and that NodeJS ES modules would not need to themselves be built for the browser The test cases here cover nesting invalid values and subpaths A package json without an esm true property or an invalid esm property is treated as if it contained esm false ie js files as CommonJS modules Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x tests and or benchmarks are included documentation is changed or added x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s Provide affected core subsystem s like doc cluster crypto etc esmodules,,"guybedford,targos,guybedford,targos,guybedford,devsnek,bmeck,bmeck,bmeck,jasnell,bmeck,bmeck,guybedford,guybedford",2018-01-15 13:04:22,2018-01-26 11:08:05

PR,process js fast path for cached bindings,Currently both process binding and internalBinding have to call into C regardless of whether the module has been cached or not This creates significant overhead to all binding calls and unfortunately the rest of the codebase does not really optimize the amount of times that bindings are required as an example 12 files require the async wrap binding Changing all the usage of this function throughout the codebase would introduce a lot of churn and is kind of a hassle so instead this PR introduces a JS fast path for both functions for cases where the binding has already been cached While micro benchmarks are not super meaningful here it is not like we call binding that often this does speed up the cached call by 400 Thank you for your pull request Please provide a description above and review the requirements below Bug fixes and new features should include tests and possibly benchmarks Contributors guide Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s Provide affected core subsystem s like doc cluster crypto etc process src,,"apapirovski,TimothyGu,bnoordhuis,bnoordhuis,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,apapirovski,MylesBorins,joyeecheung,MylesBorins",2018-01-25 04:34:44,2018-01-29 16:56:47

IS,vm Script could be used to hide the source by shipping only bytecode,I was playing with this idea this morning and asked me to put this into words vm Script vm new vm script code options can be used to produce a cache into a buffer and also used to load from existing cache produced earlier With Ignition bytecode interpreter launched in V8 we could abuse it to only ship bytecode and hide the source The thing with Ignition is once a function has been compiled we do not need the source code anymore The optimizing compiler can construct the graph from bytecode alone So a script can be fully shipped as bytecode There are a couple things missing though For a proof of concept these issues can be hacked before actually thinking about changing the V8 API to accommodate Eager compilation every function must be compiled to bytecode already V8 does not do that out of the box but there is a command line flag called serialize eager that you could turn on to force eager compilation if a code cache is being created The source vm Script expects the script source to be provided always With Ignition we do not actually need it but we have a checksum when deserializing to check that the source matches expectation The checksum is simply the script length at this point So an empty string with the same length would do Platform dependency V8 is serializer simply walks and serializes the object graph In case of code cache we walk the object graph of the function SharedFunctionInfo Depending on whether the platform is 32 or 64 bit the object layout is different and the code cache would look different I'm not 100 sure whether x64 and arm64 would produce the same code cache either Version dependency V8 is bytecode is purely internal and not versioned So for a different version of V8 the bytecode needs to be recompiled Function prototype toString would just show a window from whatever the dummy source was provided Duh Once these issues are solved you could ship bytecode and hide the source without worrying about crashing the optimizing compiler Oh and this would only work on versions where V8 uses Ignition For example at this shameless plug,,"hashseed,bmeck,hashseed,davidmarkclements,hashseed,refack,hashseed,bmeck,hashseed,Trott,bmeck,TimothyGu",2017-03-14 14:02:32,2018-02-01 00:21:48

PR,http process array headers after setting up agent,http client accepts the headers option as an Array This is not documented but is used in 4 places in our tests parallel test http parallel test http server multiheaders parallel test http server multiheaders2 parallel test http upgrade client I believe it traces all the way back to an old API that was refactored and this support was left in There is some utility in it however it is likely to be slightly more efficient as it skips a few tests and does header setting in batch and sends them straight away it is also the only way to set full multi headers see parallel test http server multiheaders for an example of this as well as the test case in this PR There are a few drawbacks however one of which I believe is a bug and is fixed with this PR the logic to determine whether to use a keep alive connection happens after the array headers are stored and sent so it ends up defaulting to Connection keep alive regardless of how you set your http client up The same request using an object to set headers sets Connection close This can lead to an unexpected client hang as the connection remains open till timeout Compare http request port 1337 path ' ' headers foo 'bar' with http request port 1337 path ' ' headers 'foo' 'bar' You get close with the former and keep alive with the latter This PR rearranges the logic to set the array headers later allowing the keep alive logic to run before actually setting the Connection header The other two problems with array headers is that they you do not get the Host header set and options auth wo not work The test case in this PR confirms that These two are arguably bugs but it is going to require some non trivial work to make it happen particularly if we want to avoid directly appending the submitted array which I think would be our goal So I want to check here first before doing anything about that I also have a branch where I'm toying with removing array headers but it is sufficiently embedded in both http client js and http outgoing js and we have 4 test cases showing examples that I'm uneasy just pushing ahead with that as it would be a breaking change and it is not unlikely that there is lot of people using array headers out there in the wild I have not even looked at what would happen on the server side for sending headers since http outgoing js appears to make it possible to do the same thing there I think my preference would be to formalise array headers as an option and even document it but it would require fixing auth and host Interested to hear what others think,,"rvagg,BridgeAR,rvagg,jasnell,rvagg,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,ronkorving,BridgeAR,BridgeAR",2017-10-28 07:09:38,2018-02-01 09:29:17

IS,Proposal change deprecation policy,The current node deprecation policy is very difficult for certain sets of node users to find out about breaking changes between LTS enabled node versions With node is tick tock even odd release cycle where odd numbered releases will never enter an LTS mode it is very possible to miss the deprecation of a much relied upon feature because there is no business reason for me to test my code against a version of node that I will never release my services on top of As with 12976 many people who rely on not having to provide callbacks to asynchronous functions would have been caught blind by migrating from 6 to 8 skipping over the deprecation warning entirely and going from this works to this kills my node process entirely Given the speed at which the node community releases major versions 4 was released like barely over a year ago and we are almost to 8 it would be extremely beneficial to extend the deprecation period to always include an LTS enabled version of the project This way us leapfroggers do not have to deal with vastly unexpected issues with our code bases and can provide feedback on breaking changes during an appropriate window without the added baggage of trying to get a rollback performed,,"ChALkeR,jasnell,mscdex,Trott,jasnell,Trott,mscdex,jasnell,mscdex,jasnell,mscdex,jasnell,MylesBorins,sam-github,mhdawson,sam-github,jasnell,Trott,BridgeAR",2017-05-12 18:15:08,2018-02-09 00:29:12

IS,async hooks for promises is PromiseWrap parentId actually useful,On PromiseWrap objects we expose a parentId property L385 L387 The semantics of the property are If the promise has a parent promise parentId will be the asyncId of the parent promise By definition async hooks triggerid and by implementation L318 L320 parentId must match the triggerAsyncId available in the Init hook as the parent promise is the trigger cause of the child async resource promise to be created The parentId is redundant information in this case The only case where parentId would be different from triggerAsyncId is when a promise has no parent In this case the parentId will be undefined and the triggerAsyncId would correspond to the current execution id It seems the only information that parentId provides is whether or not i e boolean the promise has a parent Is there something more subtle here that I might be missing I would like to go ahead and document that if that is the case cc diagnostics async hooks,,"ofrobots,AndreasMadsen,ofrobots,ofrobots,AndreasMadsen,ofrobots",2018-01-31 01:25:16,2018-02-12 12:28:35

PR,lib new error implementation,This implements a function based error system Instead of passing in the error code as first argument the error code itself is a error class It already contains the correct error type so while adding a new error no one has to think about the error type anymore In case a single error code has more than one error type the error class has properties for the non default error types Those can be used as fallback This prevents typos makes the implementation easier and it is less verbose when writing the code for a new error The implementation itself does not interfere with the old implementation So the old and the new system can co exist and it is possible to slowly migrate the old ones to the new system By doing this I also realized that there are multiple error codes that are currently not used at all I also found other mistakes where a wrong error type was in place So far this is only WIP and I wanted to get some feedback Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x tests and or benchmarks are included x documentation is changed or added x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s Provide affected core subsystem s like doc cluster crypto etc lib,,"BridgeAR,addaleax,devsnek,mscdex,jasnell,jasnell,TimothyGu,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,joyeecheung,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,BridgeAR,MylesBorins,BridgeAR",2018-02-18 20:26:39,2018-02-22 14:04:22

IS,Bikeshedding question new home for V8 is GYP files,As you all might know Chrome has moved off GYP in favor of GN as build system V8 has followed that move but kept maintaining gyp configs for longer than Chrome requires mostly for Node js In the past weeks I have as planned implemented a GYP GN bridge so that V8 as Node js' dependency can be built with GN This means that in order to test V8 against Node js the V8 team no longer has to maintain GYP We will probably be getting rid of GYP configs in upstream V8 in this quarter Node js will need to take ownership over these files at least before it has found an alternative to GYP Question is where should these files reside Should they stay in deps v8 even though they no longer exist in upstream V8 I'm sure we can make this work without affecting updating V8 too much by tweaking gitignore files Or should they live in node core for example tools or a new build subfolder I do not have any strong opinion on this but would like to experiment with this to prepare for handover,,"hashseed,addaleax,ofrobots,targos,hashseed,mhdawson,targos",2018-01-19 21:35:19,2018-02-23 08:54:44

PR,buffer improve fill normalizeEncoding performance,This improves the performance of Buffer fill and of normalizeEncoding The latter focuses on the common cases as can be seen in the benchmarks I made the Buffer isEncoding implementation stricter again after it was loosened in 7207 It will not return true for an empty string anymore normalizeEncoding is now also stricter and it returns undefined for false NaN and 0 undefined null and '' are still valid utf8 encodings The Buffer fill implementation will now also throw an OOB error in case end is a negative value This makes it consistent with start and it helps to identify issues since before it would just been ignored instead Buffer fill will throw the errors in JS from now on in case the OOB is detected in c and those errors contain the proper error code from now on Buffer fill will from now on also accept null as valid utf8 encoding in case a string is provided That was not the case before but we do accept it in other places and that makes it more consistent details summary Buffer fill performance summary pre confidence improvement accuracy buffers buffer fill js n 20000 size 10 type 'fill ' 16 25 5 16 6 89 9

IS,repeated property access misses leads to memory spike and slowdown in 6 x and 8 x,We were investigating a strange memory leak related to an issue and believe it may be a V8 or nodejs regression Simple example Starting from an empty object literal the code attempts about 24 million property accesses with a non integer key Our expectation is a small increase in memory usage We added some console log statements to see process memoryUsage before and after the call Results are shown in the table below node ver v8 version time s delta rss heapTotal v0 8 28 3 11 10 26 5 795 58355712 40684288 v0 10 48 3 14 5 11 3 903 57769984 39685120 v0 12 18 3 28 71 20 3 348 30461952 15943424 v4 8 4 4 5 103 47 3 546 34959360 18562816 v6 11 2 5 1 281 103 12 180 348672000 334577664 v8 2 1 5 8 283 41 13 011 453771264 426258432 The memory usage is an order of magnitude larger than expected in node 6 and node 8,,"vsemozhetbyt,bnoordhuis,apapirovski",2017-08-06 20:07:54,2018-03-02 15:44:01

PR,buffer remove noAssert and improve performance,This PR contains the following main changes 1 Remove the noAssert argument from all buffer functions 2 Port write float double functions to JS 3 Improve write float double performance significantly 4 Improve read float double performance significantly 5 Remove implicit offset coercion to uin32 6 Remove implicit byteLength coercion to uint32 7 The code is mainly simpler to understand read 8 Faster code in all regular cases 9 Renamed tests properly Update There is no performance penalty in the regular case anymore Instead there is a constant performance gain Only while using noAssert true some cases exist that got a minor performance penalty This mainly applies to all Buffer write read U Int d d B L E functions Now it will not be possible

PR,src http2 use native layer pipe mechanism from FileHandle instead of synchronous I O,Hi everyone This PR resolves the issue of using synchronous I O for file backed HTTP 2 streams by turning FileHandle s into currently read only StreamBase instances adding a generic mechanism to pipe from a StreamBase into another StreamBase where currently the latter one needs to know that it wants to have data written to it which is true for HTTP 2 streams This could probably land as it is but I ve marked it as WIP because the code probably isn t quite documented yet and I want to investigate more into the performance of these changes The http2 respond with fd benchmark shows a 30 update down to more like 20 performance drop for me At least part of that is likely related to the way the benchmark is written It performs tens or hundreds of reads for the same portion of the same short file in order to return data to the client In particular the kernel will always immediately have the data available and will never need to perform actual disk operations so synchronous reads actually come with less overhead than asynchronous reads to begin with In some way that s realistic A lot of the time data will already be in the kernel cache On the other hand Node has committed to avoiding synchronous I O and we can t really know whether disk I O will be slow or fast in advance A lot of these assumptions are based on the fact than when I add a nanosleep call with 1 ns duration which obviously takes longer than 1 ns but it appears to be enough to the pread64 syscall the 30 drop turns into a whopping 100 perf win In any case I d love to hear ideas and suggestions both about the general approach and its performance here cc http2 Commits http2 simplify timeout tracking There s no need to reset the chunk counter for every write src make FileHandle a readonly StreamBase This enables accessing files using a more standard pattern Once some more refactoring has been performed on the other existing StreamBase streams this could also be used to implement fs streams in a more standard manner src give StreamBases the capability to ask for data Add a OnStreamWantsWrite event that allows streams to ask for more input data if they want some src introduce native layer stream piping Provide a way to create pipes between native StreamBase instances that acts more directly than a pipe call would http2 use native pipe instead of synchronous I O This resolves the issue of using synchronous I O for respondWithFile and respondWithFD and enables scenarios in which the underlying file does not need to be a regular file http2 remove regular file only restriction Requiring respondWithFile to only work with regular files is an artificial restriction on Node s side and has become unnecessary Offsets or lengths cannot be specified for those files but that is an inherent property of other file types Checklist Remove items that do not apply For completed items change to x x make j4 test UNIX or vcbuild test Windows passes x tests and or benchmarks are included x documentation is changed or added x commit message follows commit guidelines commit message guidelines Affected core subsystem s src http2 CI CI CI,,"addaleax,fhinkel,addaleax,mcollina,addaleax,mcollina,maclover7,addaleax,mcollina,addaleax,mcollina,addaleax,fhinkel,addaleax,jasnell,apapirovski,addaleax,addaleax,mcollina,addaleax,mcollina,addaleax,mcollina,addaleax,addaleax,mcollina,addaleax,mcollina,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,maclover7,addaleax,jasnell,jasnell,addaleax,addaleax,addaleax,targos,addaleax",2018-02-22 14:16:29,2018-03-15 11:54:57
