IS,Different prediction when manually creating batch,Hey everyone I'm using mxnet cu80 0 11 0 under Debian 8 I was playing around with adversarial perturbations using mxnet and I noticed some strange behavior I have a batch which comes from an ImageIter which reads a rec file and for this batch the classifier seems to do the right prediction namely for the first example in the batch I get label 956 However when I create my own batch in the following way the classifier predicts a different label for the first data point For the original batch I get the output 956 577 201 64 412 307 314 141 54 641 whereas I get 479 845 845 845 845 845 845 845 845 845 for the new batch so I was wondering why the classifier predicts a different class in this case and how I could fix this behavior I also tried removing the dataDesc however this does not influence the classification EDIT I think this is not happening when using is train False however as I need the gradient w r t the input I think I have to set is train to True Also I'm using ResNet50 with the ImageNet dataset if this is of any importance Thanks Max,,szha,2017-08-21 11:59:45,2017-11-20 12:26:27

IS,How to use an LSTM Layer in CNN,I would like to use an LSTM layer in CNN Specifically the network will first have a few convolutional layers producing output y1 from input x Then y1 is interpreted as a sequence and fed into an LSTM producing output y2 at the last step Finally y1 and y2 is fed together into one or more layers which can be convolutional fully connected or any other reasonable layers to produce the final output z The whole network is supposed to be trained jointly in an end to end manner How can I create the symbol of such a network with MXNet I can conveniently achieve this in Caffe The only thing that I need to do is adding an LSTM layer in prototxt just like adding any other layers BTW the size of inputs of the network will be determined on the fly and module binding is performed each time the input size changes Currently I am considering to use the RNN Cell Symbol API But it seems that problems exist For example 1 I wo not be able to reset the cell when unrolling stepping for a new sequence by calling lstm cell reset since the LSTMCell is only used when defining the symbol of the network 2 Loading or saving RNN models are supposed to be done by calling RNN specific functions such as mx rnn do rnn checkpoint which seem to be incompatible with non RNN layers operators If using the RNN Cell Symbol API is a feasible solution can someone provide an accessible example,,"II-Matto,eric-haibin-lin,kevinthesun,szha,II-Matto,szha,kevinthesun,II-Matto",2017-12-01 12:15:53,2017-12-03 02:51:12

PR,Remove finalizers from Scala API,Description This implements Fix 1 from this discussion on discuss mxnet io as well as fixing various resource leaks throughout the Scala library separate commit The short version is MXNet is not safe to call from multiple threads Finalizers call from a separate thread in Java so they are unsafe to use to call MXNet We have seen this cause memory corruption and failures Removing the finalizers means one can inadvertently leak resources that should be disposed For this reason optional tracing behaviour is added to the library to help users track down leaks The separate commit fixing leaks fixes as many leaks as were required for us to do large prediction tasks hundreds of millions of predictions using a Module without incurring either memory corruption as we did before the finalizers were removed or memory exhaustion as we did after they were removed We now see no detected leaks However for training we still see a relatively small number Checklist Essentials x Passed code style checking make scalapkg x Changes are complete i e I finished coding on this PR x All changes have test coverage see below x For user facing API changes API doc string has been updated For new C functions in header files their functionalities and arguments are well documented x To my best knowledge examples are either not affected by this change or have been fixed to be compatible with this change Changes x WarnIfDisposed trait replaces finalizers no tests API docs updated to remove references to the GC strategy x Leaks fixes no tests no visible functional change Comments We did not find a non intrusive way to write a test suite for these changes Let us know if we should try harder to find one,,"calumleslie,yzhliu,calumleslie,marcoabreu,calumleslie,marcoabreu,calumleslie,piiswrong,marcoabreu,calumleslie,calumleslie,calumleslie,marcoabreu,calumleslie",2017-11-30 09:32:12,2017-12-04 18:01:12

PR,Ci test randomness,This PR proposes two new features to how CI uses random data for testing 1 A 'with np random seed NNN ' syntax to allow a single test to run with a set seed without forcing determinism on other tests in the same file and 2 A set np random seed util function to set the seed randomly and output that setting to the nosetests log file This permits a failure seen in a log file to be reproduced exactly Numerous individual tests have been also made more robust Most often the failures were the result of the finite difference method gradient not matching the symbol is gradient at a point when the gradient was either large e g cube root or discontinuous e g max In other cases tolerances needed to be added or increased The proposed new approach is demonstrated on a simple test file of three tests Assuming that the second test needs a set seed for robustness the file might currently appear as set np random seed is in the global region of the test file and will set the seed differently for each run The value set will appear in the nosetests output The body of the test op2 test now appears after the 'with np random seed 1234 ' statement This has the effect of setting the seed before the test runs then reinstating the rng state after the test is over failed or passed Thus test op3 will run with non deterministic data Finally if say test op1 fails the seed is known so the failure can be reproduced Further use of np random get state and np random set state can result in a modified test file that can be invoked as 'nosetests verbose s test file py test op1' Checklist Essentials x Passed code style checking make lint x Changes are complete i e I finished coding on this PR x All changes have test coverage x For user facing API changes API doc string has been updated x To my best knowledge examples are either not affected by this change or have been fixed to be compatible with this change Changes Feature1 tests and when applicable API doc Feature2 tests and when applicable API doc Comments If this change is a backward incompatible change why must this change be made Intersting edge cases to note here,,"DickJC123,larroy,larroy,cjolivier01,DickJC123,larroy,piiswrong",2017-10-17 04:13:52,2017-12-12 22:16:59

PR,Remove defunct demo,I have spent 4 hours working through the demo trying to get it working It has problems so severe that I don t think it s worth trying to salvage it This example might make a good blog entry for people who are thoroughly versed in Kaldi an Open Source automatic speech recognition ASR project and who are interested in an MXNet wrapper for it but does not stand alone as an introductory example to speech recognition suitable for inclusion in the MXNet repo Alternatively an ASR expert could perhaps rework this example and resubmit it if it illustrated general MXNet concepts Specific criticisms that lead me to propose removing the demo altogether Depends on Kaldi which is a bear to install and compile but I got there in the end The example includes a Python wrapper around Kaldi which does not compile Editing the makefile to remove the link dependency on thread kaldi thread a allowed it to compile but I have no idea if the result will work as intended The discussion of preparing data gives no hint of where you would download compatible data or transcripts It tells you to run Kaldi scripts that barf and ask where your Fisher transcripts are The example has vague instructions to go read the Kaldi docs but does not even give a title or topic that you should go looking for The tutorial is full of acronyms that appear to have ASR specific meanings that are never explained and that a user of MXNet would not reasonably be expected to know e g AMI does not mean Amazon Machine Image Similarly TIMIT is a speech corpus,,"simoncorstonoliver,piiswrong,Soonhwan-Kwon,simoncorstonoliver,piiswrong,simoncorstonoliver,Soonhwan-Kwon,vsooda",2017-12-13 23:34:33,2017-12-18 18:36:39

PR,Re enable all op segments when in batch mode,Description This patch fixes a performance regression that is causing a roughly 20 slowdown in some inference scenarios I have not investigated in depth how wide spread this issue is but at a minimum it is affecting inference with a resnet model and a batch size of 1 I'm not totally familiar with the commit that makes the change but to me it looks like the regression occurred because of a refactor in the graph executor that improves readability The performance problems occur because we introduce a number of cudaStreamSyncronize calls which lower our overall gpu utilization likely due to a restricted execution plan that leads to a lower overall SM occupancy It is not clear to me if this would cause any issues when running inference in a non GPU environment It is possible that the change in operator segmentation behaviour was intended and has other useful implications If so we should be able to modify the code so that we get both the intended benefits and the faster performance Investigation After verifying the regression on a demonstration model we did some high level measurements to see if any trends emerged We saw two stats that helped diagnose the issue First the gpu usage during inference dropping from 95 to 85 Second we had a large increase in the number of cudaStreamSynchronize calls 0 9 5 cuda calls Note the number of cudaStreamSynchronize calls increases from 2401 to 48601 Once this PR has been applied our models return to exactly 2401 calls We verified that the cudaStreamSynchronize calls were responsible for the low GPU utilization with some further profiling The following images show a timeline view of one inference call through the model A timespan is highlighted at the top of the timeline to show relative performance Gaps in the compute row show the relative utilization of the GPU I have also added a little instrumentation that adds our existing profiling names to nvidia is tool is timeline very small change will PR it separately after Chris is awesome profiling work is merged This also highlights the difference in behaviour when we are segmenting operators The 0 9 5 and 1 0 with this PR builds both group operators together into a single segment for a single inference The 0 12 build breaks operators apart into several segments 0 9 5 0 9 5 with tracing 0 12 0 12 with tracing 1 0 with PR applied 1 0 with fix and tracing Checklist Essentials x Passed code style checking make lint x Changes are complete i e I finished coding on this PR x All changes have test coverage Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness e g adding a new operator Nightly tests are added for complicated long running ones e g changing distributed kvstore Build tests will be added for build configuration changes e g adding a new build option with NCCL x Code is well documented For user facing API changes API doc string has been updated For new C functions in header files their functionalities and arguments are documented For new examples README md is added to explain the what the example does the source of the dataset expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable x To the my best knowledge examples are either not affected by this change or have been fixed to be compatible with this change Changes x Performance regression fix While refactoring this function it appears we introduced an unexpected side effect a number of cudaStreamSyncCalls which caused a slowdown in performance Comments This needs to be reviewed by someone with familiarity with this graph executor Tests are passing and the performance tests I have run have been sped up by a factor of 20 but I would like to have a discussion around the performance implications of this change Could this negatively affect some aspect of MXNet performance for example CPU inference large batched prediction etc This change also groups together several operators into the same reported segment from the profiler Is this the right thing to do from the users is perspective,,"KellenSunderland,eric-haibin-lin,eric-haibin-lin,eric-haibin-lin,eric-haibin-lin,piiswrong,KellenSunderland,eric-haibin-lin,KellenSunderland,eric-haibin-lin,marcoabreu,KellenSunderland,KellenSunderland,KellenSunderland,piiswrong,marcoabreu,nicklhy,larroy",2017-12-13 12:48:51,2018-01-15 20:05:11

PR,Expand gpu kernel launch synchronous error checking,Background and discovered that if MXNet were built without a suitable kernel binary or PTX for the GPU in the system MXNet might produce incorrect results rather than print an error message and exit The problem is that the no kernel for device error is synchronous to the kernel launch and so needs to be identified by a cudaPeekAtLastError or cudaGetLastError call executed by the CPU thread launching the kernel This is best done right after the triple chevron kernel launch statement and mshadow and much of MXNet already perform this check through the MSHADOW CUDA POST KERNEL CHECK macro This PR expands use of MSHADOW CUDA POST KERNEL CHECK to cover any triple chevron kernel launches where it is missing e g the generic Kernel Launch and Kernel LaunchEx routines I have verified the original scenario of an improperly built MXNet now exits with an error message I did not add a CI test as this would have required creating a new test only operator and hooking it to a kernel that fails at launch Checklist Essentials Passed code style checking make lint Changes are complete i e I finished coding on this PR All changes have test coverage Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness e g adding a new operator Nightly tests are added for complicated long running ones e g changing distributed kvstore Build tests will be added for build configuration changes e g adding a new build option with NCCL Code is well documented For user facing API changes API doc string has been updated For new C functions in header files their functionalities and arguments are documented For new examples README md is added to explain the what the example does the source of the dataset expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable To the my best knowledge examples are either not affected by this change or have been fixed to be compatible with this change Changes Feature1 tests and when applicable API doc Feature2 tests and when applicable API doc Comments If this change is a backward incompatible change why must this change be made Interesting edge cases to note here,,"DickJC123,marcoabreu,DickJC123,marcoabreu,marcoabreu,DickJC123,marcoabreu",2018-01-25 03:39:23,2018-01-30 18:45:25

PR,New layer split like,Description This PR introduces split like layer which is similar to reshape like layer The layer takes the first dim of the input shape lhs and splits it into two dims which it gets from the reference shape rhs This layer implements a simple operation but this operation has a big payoff for high level frameworks that want to do fast bucketing If you want to do fast bucketing you have to avoid unrolling compiling the network more than once For GPU we have layers like RNN layer which make this possible But an additional requirement is that the sequence length never appear in the shape parameters of any Reshape ops otherwise we are forced to make new symbols instead of simply reshaping old executors Currently there is a common idiom which unfortunately requires we hardcode the sequence length into a Reshape My split like allows us to implement this idiom without hardcoding sequence length The idiom I mentioned is a way to efficiently map an operation over a sequence 1 take a tensor with shape in1 seq batch d1 d2 2 merge the first two dims with Reshape using shape 3 2 to give in2 seq batch d1 d2 3 perform some ordinary op or ops that naturally maps over the batch dimension to give out1 seq batch e1 e2 4 split the first dimension of the output back into two to give out2 seq batch e1 e2 seq does not have to come before batch it could be the other way but the point is the same in step 4 we need to reverse the split operation that we performed in step 2 Unfortunately we cannot hard code either the batch size or the max sequence length into a Reshape layer because if we do we prevent an existing executor from being resized when we wish change that parameter But there is no simple way to go from seq batch to seq batch without knowing at least one of them and hardcoding it into the Reshape using current MXNet ops split op makes this easy you can just use the original tensor in1 as the reference tensor giving us out2 split layer lhs out1 rhs in1 When you have a large number of buckets the performance savings from doing this can be enormous It is possible to cache the original JSON and attempt to build a template of it such that you can produce new JSON more cheaply but that is a complicated and hacky prospect compared to having the executor be naturally resizable which split layer allows Checklist Essentials Passed code style checking make lint I get ModuleNotFoundError No module named 'cpplint' but the code is mostly copy pasted from reshape like so it is probably ok x Changes are complete i e I finished coding on this PR All changes have test coverage split like is almost a direct copy of reshape like which seems to have no direct test coverage What should I do x For user facing API changes API doc string has been updated For new C functions in header files their functionalities and arguments are well documented x To my best knowledge examples are either not affected by this change or have been fixed to be compatible with this change Comments 1 This seems like the only simple way of achieving executor resizability for the idiom I mentioned but maybe I'm missing something and it is already possible 2 Also I am wondering if we should maybe introduce a merge dims layer that is equivalent to the current shape 3 2 spec of Reshape It would be more symmetrical and the truth is that these two operations split and merge are all I ever used those codes in Reshape for anyway So if we introduce merge' we could deprecate those old codes and perhaps remove them in a few versions time That would also help Reshape get better backward shape inference and keep it simpler for people to understand,,"taliesinb,eric-haibin-lin,taliesinb,eric-haibin-lin,taliesinb,cjolivier01,cjolivier01,marcoabreu,piiswrong,taliesinb,piiswrong",2017-12-05 06:49:25,2018-01-31 19:47:56

PR,TVM bridge support to JIT NDArray Function by TVM,Support wrap TVM compiled function as an NDArray function This enables use TVM as RTC module for MX is async function Example Technical Details The bridge is quite natural as MXNet already uses DLTensor representation which is used by TVM The hard part is that we need to use MXNet is engine to run the compiled function instead of running them directly Since TVM relies on LLVM it is a bit too early to directly introduce this dependency This PR does this differently The TVM bridge depends on a header only component of TVM and does not have to link against tvm runtime When a user has TVM installed in their environment TVM queries the MXTVMBridge function to get the wrapper logic and use it to run MXNet is function asynchronously When a user does not have TVM installed the additional logic wo not add any additional link dependencies Because of this optional linking logic I did not include test case for MXNet is CI But have verified that the code works locally on GPU and CPU case here Restriction MXNet and TVM need to be built with same C ABI because we pass around PackedFunc This is somewhat a restriction but makes the code sharing easier by using the PackedFunc system This usually can be achieved by using the same c compiler For example g 4 8 and g 5 0 are not compatible usually the latest version of clang is compatible with latest version of g running incompatible ABI will cause undefined behavior in the code and possible segfault This restriction can be possibly removed by forcing a pure C ABI but requires additional work and may also affect the conciseness of code,,"tqchen,szha,tqchen,marcoabreu,marcoabreu,marcoabreu,marcoabreu,tqchen,cjolivier01,cjolivier01,cjolivier01,tqchen,tqchen,tqchen,tqchen,cjolivier01,cjolivier01,cjolivier01,tqchen,tqchen,cjolivier01,cjolivier01,marcoabreu,piiswrong,tqchen,piiswrong,tqchen,tqchen,cjolivier01,tqchen,piiswrong,tqchen,tqchen,tqchen,tqchen,tqchen,tqchen,tqchen,tqchen,marcoabreu,tqchen,marcoabreu,tqchen,tqchen,cjolivier01,tqchen,tqchen,marcoabreu,tqchen,tqchen,piiswrong,tqchen,tornadomeet,tqchen,tqchen,tornadomeet,tqchen",2018-02-25 05:19:13,2018-02-27 16:41:29

PR,Random shuffle implementation,Description This operator randomly shuffles the elements of an NDArray along the last axis i e it performs a batched shuffling For example if you shuffle a matrix 2D array the elements in each row are shuffled inside the row and the shufflings in different rows are statistically independent So for each element all indices except the last one perserved but the last one changes randomly Motivation 1 Random shuffle is a widely used operation so that most of the random number APIs such as those of numpy or C have it while mxnet lacks the operation It would be useful especially for the shuffling of the arrays in gpu 2 If this PR is accepted I would like to open a separate PR which removes the dependency of mxnet python API on the global random number generators of python and numpy I think that the dependency is not sound because it introduces an unnecessary coupling between mxnet and other parts of a user is environment This can be a source of subtle technical or mathematical bugs Personally I have spent some amount of meaningless time to figure out the source of an unexpected randomness due to the coupling The dependency has confused many newcomers for example see 9978 9335 7124 and 736 To replace random number generations through the global generators of python and numpy with the generations through the operations of mx nd random we need to copy the data back and forth between a numpy array and an NDArray or a python list and an NDArray but I think that the overhead from this is not significant and avoiding the coupling is much more important When I actually tried the replacing the only obstacle was that mxnet does not support the random shuffling So I implemented it However I think that the suffling is useful regardless of this motivation and so opened a separate PR Implementation 1 In cpu the shuffling is delegated to gnu parallel random shuffle which utilizes openmp for gcc and clang and to std shuffle for other compilers The shufflings in a batch are processed sequentially one by one 2 In gpu a random key of double type is generated for each element of the array and then the elements are sorted by the keys The keys for n th batch is distributed in the range n n 1 and the entire array is sorted by the keys at once The sorting is delegated to mshadow is SortByKey which again delegates the call to thrust is sort by key If both of the batch size and the length of the last axis are very large the qualitiy of the shuffling could be bad in this implementation i e the outcomes may not be uniformly distributed It is because as n grows the number of floating point numbers in n n 1 becomes smaller and so the probability that there are duplicated keys grows However I believe that it hardly causes a problem in practice If this is not acceptable an alternative implementation is to process the shufflings in a batch sequentially However this alternative shows very poor performance comparing to the current implementation even when the batch size is some hundreds 3 Inplace shuffling is allowed Checklist Essentials x Passed code style checking make lint x Changes are complete i e I finished coding on this PR x All changes have test coverage Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness e g adding a new operator Nightly tests are added for complicated long running ones e g changing distributed kvstore Build tests will be added for build configuration changes e g adding a new build option with NCCL Code is well documented For user facing API changes API doc string has been updated For new C functions in header files their functionalities and arguments are documented For new examples README md is added to explain the what the example does the source of the dataset expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable x To the my best knowledge examples are either not affected by this change or have been fixed to be compatible with this change,,"asitstands,cjolivier01,asitstands,asitstands,piiswrong,asitstands,piiswrong,CodingCat,asitstands",2018-03-05 06:52:23,2018-03-07 11:10:18
