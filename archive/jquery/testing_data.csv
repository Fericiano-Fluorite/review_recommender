IS,Getting element width after applying a class returns it is width before font family is applied,Description I have an anchor button that has an onclick function to add elements into a webpage In this case I'm adding buttons that you can drag and resize with jQuery UI I have added this function into jQuery to retrieve the element minimum width which is its text width Now I should be able to put the minimum width for jQuery UI resizable but actually I'm getting a wrong width After a couple of days investigating why it is giving different values I have found that this happens because the CLASS attribute that I have defined for buttons has a config like color rgba 169 170 165 1 font normal 22 22222328186035px 1 3em open sans sans serif and when I get the text width it retrieves the element width BEFORE the font family is applied With the class configuration I have mentioned before which is the main configurations for my buttons I get in console a width value of 58 0625px and a width value of 62 71875px if I add a timeout function with 0s delay before removing the element Font families are included from external sources and they are working when the function is called on runtime when clicking the Add button so the problem is not that the page is not loaded or font families were not loaded For standard button without changing its class name the expected correct value is the second one 62 71875px I hope it is clear enough to understand Thanks in advance Best regards Additional info Version jQuery 1 11 1 Agent Chrome 53 02785 116m,,timmywil,2016-09-26 10:49:29,2016-09-26 15:52:27

PR,Effects stabilize rAF logic align timeout logic with it,rAF logic was introduced almost three years ago relative to this commit as a primary method for scheduling animation see gh 1578 pull With it there was two substantial changes one was explicitly mentioned and the other was not First if browser window was hidden aka document hidden true it would immediately execute all scheduled animation without waiting for time pass i e tick time become 0 instead of 13 ms of a default value Which created possibility for circular executions in case if complete method executed the same animation see gh 3434 issue And the second one since then there was two ways of scheduling animation with setInterval and requestAnimationFrame but there was a difference in their execution In case of setInterval it waited default jQuery fx interval value before actually starting the new tick not counting the first step which was not set to be executed through tick method aka jQuery fx tick Whereas requestAnimationFrame first scheduled the call and executed the step method right after that counting the first call of jQuery fx timer tick was happening twice in one frame But since tests explicitly disabled rAF method i e requestAnimationFrame null and checking only setInterval logic since it is impossible to do it otherwise we missed that change Faulty logic also was presented with cancelAnimationFrame which could not clear any timers since raf scheduler did not define new timerId value Because that change was so subtle apparently no user noticed it proving that both cancelAnimationFrame and clearInterval code paths are redundant Since cancelAnimationFrame did not work properly and rAF is and was a primary used code path plus the same approach is used in other popular animation libs Therefore those code paths were removed These changes also replace two different functions which schedule the animation with one which checks what type of logic should be used and executes it appropriatley but for secondary path it now uses setTimeout making it more consistent with rAF path Since ticks are happening globally we also do not require to listen visibilitychange event It also changes the way how first call is scheduled so execution of animation will not happen twice in one frame No new tests were not introduced since now setTimeout logic should be equivalent to the rAF one but one test was changed since now we actually execute animation at the first tick Fixes gh 3434 Summary Describe what this PR does All but trivial changes e g typos should start with an issue Mention the issue number here Checklist Mark an x for completed items if you are not sure leave them unchecked and we can assist x All authors have signed the CLA at New tests have been added to show the fix or feature works x Grunt build and unit tests pass locally with these changes If needed a docs issue PR was created at Thanks Bots and humans will be around shortly to check it out,,"markelog,mgol,markelog,markelog",2017-03-06 01:09:33,2017-03-06 18:17:49

IS,css reports wrong width height in Chrome on certain zoom levels,jQuery 3 2 1 reports wrong sizes for elements with box sizing border box in Chrome v61 on certain browser zoom levels It seems to add the element is insets padding border to its width and height although the CSS width already includes the insets Demonstration In the provided test case we have two div s with 10px padding on all sides 1px border on all sides and a CSS width height set to 32px Because box sizing is set to border box the visual size of the elements is 32x32px with a remaining inner space of 10px At 100 browser zoom level this is correctly reported both by css 'width' and outerWidth If we now zoom to 110 the numbers get slightly changed probably due to some rounding errors 31 9886px instead of 32px Because we should always get CSS pixels that are not affected by browser zoom I would have expected those numbers to stay the same but I can live with that The real problem occurs when you reload the page while having the browser zoom at 110 Now the width is completely incorrect 53 977236000000005px instead of 32px If the page uses those values for programmatic layout the results will be wrong You can see the effect in the demo The CSS width and height of the first div are copied to the second so they should always be the same size However if you start at 100 the second div is much larger Analysis Analysis has shown that this seems to be caused by the internal function computeStyleTests in css support js that wrongly sets the internal property boxSizingReliableVal to false Apparently this happens because of a rounding error In my case the test div is measured width is 3 997px which is not equal to the expected value of 4px What is worse this internal property is only calculated once So when you start at 110 zoom and then reset it to 100 the problem still persists until you completely reload the page I could observe the problem at the following zoom levels 110 90 80 67 and 33 Firefox v56 and IE v11 do not seem to be affected by this problem Also with jQuery 2 1 4 everything works fine on all browsers All tests were performed on Windows 7 with default DPI and font size settings,,"gibson042,gibson042,SaptakS,timmywil,gibson042,gibson042,gibson042,mgol",2017-10-04 14:20:40,2017-12-06 05:00:04

IS,jQuery param improvement,Using the jQuery param function with some libraries I have noticed that it can throw errors if the input object has functions which expect input values For example lets say a library extends the string class and adds the following prototype to the string class in an application String prototype hasCharacter function char if char throw 'char expected' var idx this indexOf char return idx 0 They have added some code to verify if the input value is defined and throw and error so that higher up functions can handle it This is fairly normal and I have seen this behavior in a ton of code over the years If you then pass a string into the jQuery param function it will try to run this function without passing in a value using when it processes this line of code var value jQuery isFunction valueOrFunction valueOrFunction valueOrFunction I just spent half a day helping someone track down a bug in their app which came to this situation To make the jQuery param function more robust I see two possible solutions Wrap valueOrFunction with try catch Later in the code when looping through the prefix values use a proper for loop instead of a foreach at least for string values This would reduce the number of iterations in the loop thus making it faster and would also prevent this error from occurring I do not use jQuery that often so I will leave it to the community to decide the best approach to improve this,,"dmethvin,gibson042",2017-12-07 19:46:35,2017-12-08 21:45:14

IS,What is the future of jQuery in 2018,Hi so I just wanted to take an opportunity to enquire about the future of this library and what the plans are going forward in terms of updates and support Over the last few years it is fair to say the landscape has changed frameworks including Angular React and VueJS have introduced a new paradigm for writing JavaScript and in some ways made jQuery redundant to the effect that it is encouraged not to load use the library at all This is also inline with an observable decrease in the number of releases being pushed with just 3 2 and 3 2 1 this March Before that 3 1 shipped in July 2016 And whereas there were 8 blog posts in 2015 and 16 there has just been the one this year and ever since silence During this time we have seen a number of major changes in the JavaScript ecosystem including and not an exhaustive list promises arrow functions spread operator async await generators fetch api replaces ajax template literals let const and classes All of these changes can add up to one of the biggest rewrites of the library we have seen to date I question whether Ajax is still required now that Fetch is supported on all major browsers With all that said my main question is what is the plan going into 2018 and beyond in regards to jQuery it is no lie with each passing year an already aging codebase some of which has not been touched in years continues to be common across the web It would be delightful to see a v4 project attempted to try and remove any parts which are no longer required and focusing on keeping only the absolute essentials focusing on extreme performance and a modern codebase now that all these new language features have been added to the browser Thank you and I look forward to any comments this issue may generate Happy coding,,"timmywil,timmywil,dmethvin,timmywil",2017-12-11 21:40:53,2017-12-11 22:33:42
