PR,Fix for bugs 2185 4512 7111,Bug 2185 is one of the top duplicate bugs in the bug tracker This patch should also improve animation performance since it no longer checks and resets the display mode of an element every time the effect updates This patch uses inline block in all browsers except IE6 and IE7 which use a different inline hasLayout technique for elements which are block level by default This also adds two new support tests inlineBlockNeedsLayout and shrinkWrapBlocks IE6 needed some additional fixes since any element with layout will shrink wrap its content instead of allowing the content to flow outside the bounding box IE7 does not exhibit this behaviour This means that now overflow is not reset after a width height animation in IE6 This part can be backed out it is the only thing in the last two commits but doing so means that unit tests for animations that test the width height of elements after an animation will fail in IE6 because the elements are shrink wrapped to their content size There was one test that was doing this in the original test suite but the test was invalid because it was operating on an element inside a container with display none so it succeeded when it should have failed The test suite has been updated to use offscreen drawing so this does not happen again in the future Bug 4512 needed to be fixed in order to properly implement the changes for 2185 as the update exposed this broken functionality in IE when trying to show table elements This fix basically involves checking at init whether it s safe to rely on the offsetWidth Height for elements that have had display none set directly if it isn t then the CSS property is also checked This adds a new support test reliableHiddenOffsets Bug 7111 is just a quick enhancement to already existing functionality that I was able to throw in with the rest of the changes in about 5 minutes Nothing special here except to note that unlike other browsers IE does not change the overflow property if overflow x and overflow y both match so all 3 end up needing to be reset I tried to keep the animate stuff and the visible stuff in separate commits so that they can be landed separately if needed Cheers,,"csnover,jeresig",2010-10-05 20:28:43,2010-10-10 03:21:26

PR,Ability to avoid expando collisions,The potential bug I reported is here I want to be able to guarantee that my expando does not collide with another V8 is now scarily close to being able to instantiate two instances of jQuery in the same millisecond The only way I can think of to reliably do this keeping in mind the case where two copies of jQuery are deeply noConflicted is to explicitly pass in a unique prefix This patch reduces normal conflicts between different versions of jQuery by adding in the version to the expando and also exposes a second parameter to jQuery noConflict For example include jQuery myJQ jQuery noConflict true 'myUniquePrefix' Generally this is necessary for third party widgets that use jQuery and do not want to collide with whatever is on the page I did add a check to not allow a prefix to be added if the jQuery cache had been used that way no connections would be lost between old expando values The best practice here being that you call this new noConflict true 'prefix' before you use anything in the library Test cases are provided and passing for both the case when a prefix is added with or without an empty jQuery cache,,"SlexAxton,SlexAxton,rkatic,SlexAxton,rkatic,rkatic,SlexAxton,rkatic,SlexAxton,SlexAxton,rkatic,rkatic,rkatic,jeresig,rkatic,SlexAxton,cowboy,rkatic,rkatic,paulirish,rkatic,cowboy",2010-09-30 19:33:00,2010-10-11 22:36:06

PR,normalize css for left top on opera fixes draggable in jquery ui,Fix for If you look at jQuery UI is draggable demo page in Opera or run the draggable tests in the project you can see Opera is consistently a significant distance off The root cause of this is that in Opera when position is static or relative and left top are not set Opera returns the absolute position from getComputedStyle while Webkit browsers and Firefox either return 0px or auto If the values are set it seems to return those values as expected The proposed fix is to detect this error case in support and adding a new hook to cssHooks to always return auto if position is static and to return auto if the returned value is equal to the absolute position from getBoundingClientRect Making this change fixes this difference and also causes most of the draggable tests in the jQuery UI test suite to pass on Opera Two notes questions on this while seeing this 1 I was not sure if there was a better way to handle these conditional cases within the cssHooks function than just having all the if statements Since I did not see a ton of these types of fixes I opted not to overengineer but I will admit I do not have a ton of experience writing javascript and might be missing something 2 I started working on this just before the changes to css and at that time if the elem style left property was set css would return that value which would in turn make my fix for static a regression I noticed in the new css behavior that this is not the case but that now there is a new difference in the browsers i added a test case for this in the css tests Now when position is static and there is an inline left top value Webkit browsers appear to still return auto but Firefox and IE return the assigned values The test case I added just specified em values for static but px units yield the same issue,,csnover,2010-10-02 16:34:02,2010-12-30 06:49:00

PR,Pause animation when tab loses focus Fixes bug 9381,Fixes Animation frameworks have to deal with the problems that occur when requestAnimationFrame powers the animation loop and the tab loses focus The general idea is to artificially limit the interval between two animation ticks This was illustrated in Seth Ladd is Intro to HTML5 Game Development during Google I O 2011 36 He calculates the time delta between two animation ticks and limit this value to 60ms The way jQuery animations work is more complex than Seth is ones as animations are not based on the time delta between the previous tick and the current one but between the beginning of the animation startTime and the current one The only way to limit the interval between two ticks is to move the value of startTime forward in time With this 5loc patch jQuery detects when the interval takes longer than usual and moves startTime accordingly to effectively pause the animation Once the tab is focused again the animation continues where it stopped,,"louisremi,louisremi,louisremi,louisremi,dmethvin",2011-07-26 14:03:46,2011-09-02 13:59:41
PR,New Flag jQuery support raf Allow disabling requestAnimationFrame for people having issues with 9381,Effects Adding jQuery support raf boolean to allow disabling the use of requestAnimationFrame to allow people to work around 9381 Just submitting for some discussion The general idea here is you would set jQuery support raf false in a codebase where you have not gotten around to properly implementing design patterns necessary to avoid queuing new animations while they are not running I feel that no matter how much we try to educate the best practices mentioned in the ticket there will still be situations where the end user can not manage to set up the animation queueing properly As coded this flag can not be changed while animations are running and thus should only be set once and only to false before any animations are queued It is likely possible to replace the current requestAnimationFrame setInterval code with a recursive setTimeout pattern that more closely approximates the rAF implementations If we were to do that you could actually probably shorten the whole thing quite effectively and allow toggling this flag while running,,"gnarf,dmethvin,timmywil,louisremi,dmethvin,louisremi,dmethvin,timmywil,timmywil,louisremi,dmethvin,gnarf,gnarf,dmethvin",2011-07-16 20:55:42,2011-09-02 14:00:39

PR,Fixed issue for undefined data values that breaks chaining,Added a check in el data key val that looks to see whether or not a value was submitted rather than whether or not a value is undefined Looking for definededness causes the return value to be the previously stored data for the key rather than the calling element This can break subsequent calls in a chain eg var foo 1 var bar element data 'foo' foo data 'bar' bar appendTo otherElement This chain would error out because the second attempt at setting data for key 'bar' would try to return the original value for the key instead of attempting to set the value and returning the calling element You still can not set the data to undefined that pre existing concern already seems to be explicitly checked and prevented in jQuery data this fix just ensures that the chain remains stable under what would likely be the most common expectation I think setting a value to undefined is a valid use case though and would be easily addressed by removing lines 102 and 104 but I do not know enough about the reasoning behind disallowing it to suggest this right now,,"rwaldron,rwaldron,timmywil",2011-09-13 17:47:19,2011-09-20 14:09:07

PR,1 8 effects,So I do not feel like this branch is by any means DONE I just want an easy way for people to look at what I'm doing and discuss it It currently passes all jQuery core unit tests in chrome so I figure its time to share it on a wider scale It currently weighs in around 150 bytes more than the current core after min and gzip jQuery 1 8 Effects To quote my own summary from an email thread My goal in the end is to have a plugin to sit alongside jQuery 1 8 like jQuery color js which implements animations that CAN be done with transitions or css animations yet lets all the complex animations fall through to the default provider in jQuery core This would allow you to define your animations in terms of CSS animation transition style apis and know that if the browser can not support CSS3 jQuery core will be doing what its doing now This plugin may or may not find its way into UI Effects Core as jQuery color already has General organization jQuery Animation is a new function which implements most of what our current doAnimation function hiding inside jQuery fn animate currently does It returns an animation object which has the standard promise methods done and fail plus a helper called finished to publish its state information to the outside world fail functions will be called with a boolean gotoEnd whenever someone stop s the animation done functions will NOT be called on stop gotoEnd but will be called whenever the animation comes to its natural completion finish functions will be called whenever the animation completes regardless of it had been stop ed jQuery Tween is very similar to the old jQuery fx so much so that it is being used as such for backwards compat It handles the actual easing get set operations for a single element and property from 0 to 100 Animations contain an array of Tweens that will be updated when their tick function is called New hook points jQuery Animation preFilter function element props opts Pre filters allow a plugin to look at the props and opts of an animation being created and overide some default functionality or do something else entirely with it The hide show special case preFilter in the code is a good example It creates its own tweens for the hide and show scope to retain access to in the finish callbacks it attaches to hook all of timmy is fxstop goodness together Pre filters are allowed to return their own object so long as it implements stop gotoEnd and finish jQuery fn animate will be none the wiser jQuery Animation tweener propsList function property value Allows you to peek at the property value combinations and decide how to create a tween for that property or value It should return truthy if it created the tween If you want the tween to be managed by the animation you should use the animation createTween property value helper or push your own object containing a run percent function to animation tweens array jQuery Tween propHooks property A get function tween set function tween hook point for individual properties with a default that uses jQuery css and element style Current Issues The special easing code right now bugs me because it really should run before the hide show preFilter but since makes it basically impossible to accept an array as a possible animated property value anyone wanting an array value will have to prepend to the preFilter perhaps not such a bad thing I have not yet tested this code for performance or potential memory leaks Should be prefilter to be in line with the example set by ajax jQuery ajaxPrefilter I would like to avoid making it jQuery animatePrefilter so jQuery Animate prefilter makes more sense to me,,"gnarf,rwaldron,rwaldron,rwaldron,rwaldron,rwaldron,rwaldron,rwaldron,rwaldron,dcherman,gnarf,gnarf,rwaldron,rwaldron,gnarf,rwaldron,gnarf,gnarf,gnarf,gnarf,gibson042,rwaldron,dmethvin,gnarf,gibson042,gibson042,gibson042,gnarf,gibson042,gnarf,gnarf,gibson042,gibson042,mikesherov,gnarf,mikesherov,gnarf,gibson042,mikesherov,gnarf,gnarf,gibson042,gnarf,mikesherov,gibson042,gnarf,gnarf,dmethvin",2012-04-08 23:02:59,2012-04-23 19:14:31

PR,Fixes Bugs 7109 and 11854,As gnarf mentions in the bug report comment 7 there is precision error in the non px start value that jQuery computes before animating In this example the start width is 33 33333 which in my Chrome 19 Linux is 94px When jQuery does this the element width becomes 2px Firefox rounds the width to 3px which seems a bit more reasonable start becomes 47 1 2 94 and the element is assigned a width of 47 133px This fix does the computation twice using the close but not quite value from the first computation as input for the second I made a calculator to see what effect this would have as well as a potential third computation and it seems the result is much more accurate This also fixes 11854 as the code was settings styles on this which is the animation object in 1 8,,"jefferyto,gibson042,staabm,staabm,mikesherov,mikesherov,gnarf,mikesherov,gibson042,gibson042,jefferyto,jefferyto,jefferyto,mikesherov,gibson042,gnarf,mikesherov,mikesherov,mikesherov,jefferyto,mikesherov,dmethvin",2012-06-03 09:13:33,2012-06-11 18:26:06

PR,Fix Manipulation Clone Unit Tests Related to gh 870,This pull request is related to gh 870 where I added a patch to fix cloning in IE10 As we reviewed the patch it was found that there was a commented unit test in the clone test on line 1258 L1258 The clone was working fine in oldIE but the unit test was failing because the html was not exactly the same oldIE was either changing the case of params or inserting a whole bunch of extra params during the clone The fix that was recommended was to check only a subset of the attributes on the object element and to check to make sure the cloned object had at least had the params that the original object element had I put the tests in an IIFE to protect any variables I used from the surrounding code and I named them in an attempt to describe the intent of the test I updated the expect to 44 instead of 39 because the unit tests adds 5 addition assertions as you can see in the following screenshot I have ran the manipulation unit tests against IE6 7 8 9 10 in BrowserStack and also Opera Firefox Safai locally on my MacBook Pro,,elijahmanor,2012-07-30 18:19:24,2012-08-20 00:57:48

PR,12266 Fixes an IE9 10 Exception When a Cross Domain iframe Exists,This Pull Request relates to The issue involved getting an exception when trying to create nested elements such as div div div div The initial jsFiddle used to recreate the issue was using a 3rd party script that injected an iframe After some trial and error I have found a way to recreate this issue reliably in IE9 10 with a reduced test case It was difficult to recreate under normal circumstances so I used the testIframeWithCallback function and made a test data manipulation iframe denied html file to assist in the testing process The trick was to create an iframe with a cross domain source before DOM Ready The interesting thing about IE9 10 is that anytime you add an iframe or an object to the DOM it will alias it is window object onto the document For example after adding an iframe to the DOM you can access that iframe is window object off of document 0 IE9 Debugger Yes that is weird and that is why buildFragment was throwing an exception because it was trying to access context 0 which was the window object from a cross domain iframe I testing this new Unit Test in IE6 7 8 9 10 before I applied the fix and it failed in IE9 IE10 as expected After applying the following fix the Unit Test passes in IE6 7 8 9 10 as well as all the other unit tests in the manipulation module,,"elijahmanor,rkatic,dmethvin,rkatic,dmethvin,rkatic,elijahmanor,mikesherov,rkatic",2012-08-21 15:27:34,2012-08-23 01:48:40

PR,1 9 Prevent Clearing Cloned Style to Affect Source Element is Style Fixes 8908,Clearing a Cloned Element is Style Causes the Original Element is Style to be Cleared Introduction In IE9 and IE10 you can run into the situation when clearing a cloned element is style will also clear out the original element is corresponding style The actual jQuery Core Ticket 8908 isolates the bug when using the background image style While I was trying to recreate and research this issue I had a feeling that there may be other styles that have the same issue so I have created a test suite checking 252 CSS1 3 styles and testing various assertions Along the way I also found some additional inconsistencies These findings are technically unrelated to the 8908 issue so I will list those inconsistencies somewhere else and we can discuss those later Source Element is Style Cleared When Cloned Element is Style Cleared IE9 IE10 After testing 252 various styles only the following 8 ended up being problematic background attachment background color background image background position background repeat background clip background origin background size IE 6 7 8 Chrome Firefox Opera Thankfully these browsers did not have the problem described in this issue when tested Proposed Solutions 1 Use Default Values when Trying to Empty Style The following fix resolves the weird issue by substituting and empty string with it is default value An object is used to store the style name and associated default value If the value happens to be an empty string then it will look in the object for a matching key and if there is a match it will use that instead Conclusion Based on the research I have done testing 252 CSS styles I have isolated this issue to only 8 styles in IE9 and IE10 I have recommended solving this issue 3 different ways but in the end the 2nd option seems best to me since it only is executed in the clone execution path and is significantly smaller than the 1st option The 3rd option of having IE fix this issue seems too late since the issue also affects IE9,,"elijahmanor,rwaldron,elijahmanor,rwaldron,dmethvin,fracmak,dmethvin,elijahmanor,elijahmanor,dmethvin,elijahmanor,timmywil,dmethvin,timmywil,dmethvin",2012-08-08 20:38:51,2012-11-18 20:01:24

PR,1 9 1 Ticket 13360 String prototype namespace breaks jQuery Event,Sugar adds methods to built in prototypes Now I realize that sentence alone will likely elicit a strong reaction especially within the jQuery team However Sugar makes an argument that there is a safe way to augment JS natives by being safe conservative in approach tons of testing and a few fundamental differences to Prototype most of this is detailed here Sugar takes a certain stance but I do see valid points to both sides of the argument However I believe that the pull request I have submitted lies outside this argument The crux of the issue is that jQuery is checking for the property namespace on an object that is assumed to be a jQuery Event but in fact may also be a string When making this assumption it should do a type check to ensure that the object is an instance of jQuery Event before assuming the property namespace on it I am anticipating a counterpoint that it is reasonable for libs to assume clean prototypes and I think there is a valid point to be made there However I have my own counterpoints to that and regardless this change can only serve to make jQuery more robust Also I believe that if you are presuming a namespace property it is reasonable to assume it to be scoped to the object you have defined it on I am probably going to remove this method from Sugar anyway 1 as an emergency fix on the assumption that this pr will take a while to be released even if it is accepted and 2 because it never fit into the lib very well anyway Thank you andrewplummer Sugar issues 265,,"andrewplummer,andrewplummer,andrewplummer,andrewplummer,andrewplummer,dmethvin,andrewplummer,gnarf,andrewplummer,gnarf,andrewplummer,andrewplummer,andrewplummer,gnarf,andrewplummer,andrewplummer",2013-01-22 05:29:01,2013-01-31 18:09:29

PR,Fix for 13388 that incidently fixes 11151,To fix 13388 I had to move the setting of the responseXXX fields into the conversion loop However given we have to set the responseText field for errors the cost in bytes proved quite prohibitive even after I saved quite a bunch by refactoring around a bit Then came the idea of calling the conversion logic even for errors That way the responseText field would be set for errors for a cost of 0 bytes Also as an added bonus this would set all responseXXX fields which the error body could should be converted to I remembered 11151 and the fact that having ajax convert the error body is something I'm asked about for at every single conference So I added a responseJSON field and I made sure the dataFilter is never called in that situation would have been a major backward incompatibility Now whenever you have an error body with a content type corresponding to one or our dataType the corresponding responseXXX field will be set see this unit test L1425 In the end this fixes a bug and adds a feature while staying backward compatible all this for a mere 16 bytes Awaiting is look to see if we can save more it is the setting of isSuccess outside of the if condition that makes most of the size increase for reasons I do not really get,,"gibson042,dmethvin,gibson042,dmethvin,dmethvin,dmethvin",2013-02-08 15:50:03,2013-02-28 19:52:47

string relative to current DOM manipulation way is utterly depressing one might even suggest that this happens due to regexp check but it is not the a href case a in that version of a code iAH code implementation regexp check is removed which does not heavily change the picture Solution for that problem might be size check of HTML string Use of code jQuery append code as an example of that idea a href big a a href small a HTML string This control is flatten disproportion in WebKit case but it also decrease performance in other browsers I suppose big HTML string is rarely acts as argument in jQuery is DOM manipulation methods maybe only in case when whole page should be reflowed besides 184 operation per second might be fast enough for that task ergo it might be more productive to dwell on more optimistic small HTML string is cases given the idea that if whether or not code iAH code should be employed was made only by proceeding outcome most of other samples then decision would be little more obvious As of perf hit examples see above some of them are rare edge cases some of them do not matter that much and some of them are not that conclusive But considering all that i would say this research is showed a lot of arguments to not use code iAH code inside of code jQuery domManip code at all,,"markelog,dmethvin,gibson042,timmywil,dmethvin",2013-03-12 11:18:38,2013-03-15

PR,A different jQuery when command when2,I'm not sure if this belongs in a pull request I'm sending it out for discussion Maybe it should just be a totally separate module The patch adds a jQuery when2 function The code borrows heavily from jQuery when The main differences from jQuery when are when2 must be called with a list as its first argument An options object may be passed as a second argument If options resolveOnFirstSuccess is true the deferred returned by when2 will be resolved as soon as any of the passed deferreds resolves In this case done callbacks will be passed index value args where index is the index of the deferred that fired If non deferreds are in the arguments to when2 the first one seen will trigger the resolve not very useful but consistent If options failOnFirstError is false the deferred returned by when2 will never fail It will collect the results from all the deferreds and pass them all back The caller gets to figure out which values if any are errors If no options are given or options failOnFirstError is true fail will be called on the master deferred on the first error as with jQuery when The args passed to fail will be index and value to indicate which deferred was rejected Any progress callbacks added to the when2 returned deferred are also called with index and value so you can tell which deferred made progress Once the master deferred has fired no further progress events are fired when2 always makes a new deferred instead of trying to re use the single deferred it is given if it only has one argument This makes the code simpler and was in any case necessary due to needing to pass index and value args to the callbacks in the single argument case when resolveOnFirstSuccess or failOnFirstError indicate that just one deferred should trigger the master A slightly radical possible future thing to add would be to co opt the progress callback and use it to instead relay resolve info each call having an index a value to show which of the passed deferreds had resolved A flag in options could request that behavior It is a perversion but it is easy to think of ways in which that could be useful It might be possible to implement jQuery when in terms of jQuery when2 I tried that originally but ran into difficulty so decided to leave it for later or never It would be easy to add convenience functions like jQuery whenAnySuccess or jQuery whenAllResolvedOrRejected that just called when2 with the correct option The aim here obviously is to provide more flexibility than when does I do not like the name when2 much but I called it that for now in the spirit of dup2 I'm sure my Javascript style wont match the jQuery style in some ways am happy to fix that I copied some of the jQuery when tests but some were too complicated to get right for when2 so I ended up adding a bunch of small tests as well Thanks for any help discussion I'm not expecting this to get merged anytime soon or even at all But I would like to hear what people think BTW the approach mirrors what you can do with Twisted is DeferredList see which gives you the same 3 behaviors fire on first callback fire on first errback fire when everything is done errors or not,,"terrycojones,terrycojones,dmethvin,terrycojones,dmethvin,terrycojones",2013-07-27 02:48:58,2013-07-27 20:01:11

PR,Use JSHint for complexity metrics,This is really more of a proof of concept and conversation starter than something to land Following up on our discussion Monday this uses the complexity measures from JSHint and sets default limits that just about all the code currently passes For the exceptions I have wrapped them in jshint directives that turn off the warnings There is also a max line length check but when set to our style guide is recommended max of 100 it is quite noisy smile Pros The comments lay out where the hot spots are so we can have a better idea of where to be careful and spend extra time in reviewing patches or refactoring Only the people who read the code need to be concerned with these comments so they are not drawing a bunch of attention from people who would naively recommend we rewrite them just to get better metrics Cons In jshint you can not restore a setting back to its original default or previous value So if you want to avoid a warning you have to turn it off completely then back on That means subsequent editing in the complex areas may make things worse and nobody will notice it What I want to do is bump the limit up around these just enough to avoid the warning There is some bug in JSHint where the warning in effects has to be in a much larger block of code to be effectve rather than being tightly around the offending function defaultPrefilter I think the inability to push pop temporary limits to specific metrics is a deal killer for this idea It might be worth looking into eslint seems like it could potentially do the job of both JSHint and jscs,,"dmethvin,scottgonzalez,dmethvin,scottgonzalez,mgol,dmethvin",2013-11-15 21:33:06,2014-02-07 02:28:17

IS,Support for XHTML,Sometimes it can not be avoided to have a browser handle HTML as XHTML It seems that there is no reason jQuery should not be able to handle namespaced XHTML markup since the only difference in the DOM interface is the namespace itself The problem is that jQuery can not find nodes in an XHTML document via calls to getElementsByTagName and the bootstrapping feature detection code as well as code for handling generated elements fails with calls to createElement The NS variants need to be used in the case of XHTML in order for the elements to be imbued with the correct DOM extensions HTMLElement CSS etc I understand that there is a wo not fix section in the guidelines that references bug 13092 Again unless you know something I do not the only DOM difference between markup that comes through as application xhtml xml and text html is the need to specify a namespace At least that is my feeling through many many years of osmosis The fix more or less reduces to detecting the XHTML namespace in the document on load and replacing calls to getElementsByTagName and createElement with getElementsByTagNameNS and createElementNS Testing the fix will almost certainly take more effort than the fix itself This is something I'm fully prepared to take on and preliminary tests are positive I would rather fix a few lines in jQuery than overhaul an entire infrastructure I'm posting this issue here to see what the general sentiment is and glean some historical information,,"dmethvin,dmethvin",2014-10-27 18:18:21,2014-11-03 16:59:45

PR,Ajax Integrated native datatype for XHR2 rich responseType support,XHR2 provides a response attribute that contains a converted response to a native object depending on the responseType arraybuffer blob document json See the response attribute I propose in this pull request to create a native datatype and response to manage this kind of response Some of previous closed tickets proposed to include a binary dataType with adhoc changes on the transport function I think it is not appropriate as the response attribute deals with more than binary data like arraybuffer but extends to blob document and json datatype In my pull request I create a native datatype to support all the four response types that are abstracted I think also that such improvements should be included as this is a new improvement in XHR that is not already included in jQuery Also trying to use a converter in the case of ArrayBuffer for example leads to a heavy loop for the conversion See Simple casting does not function In my case I have used Brain dMRI NifTI data formats that are 20MB in size and all of them need parsing after downloading which is also a heavy computation a hundred of milliseconds Also treating a binary data as text it is just not natural at all as this is already the case In any way I think we should find a solution and this is my proposition Please take a look at the tests for the usage And let is start a discussion around this,,"scottgonzalez,scottgonzalez,scottgonzalez,scottgonzalez,scottgonzalez,scottgonzalez,scottgonzalez,scottgonzalez,dmethvin,dmethvin,dmethvin,dmethvin,dmethvin,dmethvin,dmethvin,dmethvin,dmethvin",2014-02-22 14:00:48,2014-12-04 22:30:19
IS,IE8 Selector Bug,Problem Issue There is a known issue with IE8 and HTML5 that when it clones adds a non standard element to the page it adds a blank prefix to the tag and includes the colon Note non standard is not exactly correct there are standard less common elements that this also happens to jQuery is not selecting those blank prefixed elements when there is a multi stage combo selector It works with find and using the tagname without the prefix but not when using a selector pattern like ' ancestor descendant ' Refer to the example below for a clearer understanding Affected Browsers I only know this applies to IE8 I'm doubtful that it applies to other versions of IE but I'm not able to test Update My statement above is not exactly correct find does not necessarily solve the issue You will notice inconsistent behavior when you use pseudo selectors such as visible The demo shows that the IE8 bug prefixed colon is not handled using jQuery and using pseudo selectors should at least be consistent with selecting by element tagname whether it includes the prefixed elements or not That is isome element' and isome element visible' should return the same results if there are no hidden some element The behavior I found in IE8 is that isome element visible' acts like isome element visible some element visible' What I'm after is something to patch the IE prefix bug so that isome element' acts like isome element some element' Demo Test Case for IE8 testing,,"dmethvin,dmethvin,arthurvr,dmethvin,mgol,dmethvin,mgol,arthurvr,mgol,mgol,dmethvin,dmethvin,gibson042",2014-10-08 13:40:03,2014-12-05 01:34:49

IS,Performance of dimension methods significantly degraded on elements with style display none,When calling a dimension methd namely any method from this page against an element with style display none the operation of the method is significantly slower than calls against elements without that property I have been able to reproduce this behaviour in Firefox 35 0 1 on Linux Mint 17 Firefox 35 0 1 on Mac OSX Yosemite 10 10 and Chrome 40 0 2214 115 on Mac OSX Yosemite 10 10 using JQuery 2 1 0 2 1 1 and 2 1 3 I have provided a demonstration here This test performs 10000 calls for each dimension accessor against both a visible and hidden div printing timing information to the console Below is a sample output from my own machine Visible width x10000 523 7117869999993 milliseconds Hidden width x10000 3993 656594000002 milliseconds Visible inner width x10000 329 250270999999 milliseconds Hidden inner width x10000 3206 354399 milliseconds Visible outer width x10000 203 91570500000125 milliseconds Hidden outer width x10000 3000 1816860000017 milliseconds Visible height x10000 448 7823769999959 milliseconds Hidden height x10000 3588 971694 milliseconds Visible inner height x10000 402 9364519999981 milliseconds Hidden inner height x10000 3882 8088529999986 milliseconds Visible outer height x10000 250 1539499999999 milliseconds Hidden outer height x10000 3624 321419 milliseconds These indicate that dimension calls against hidden elements take 8 15x longer than those for visible elements What led me to discover this issue was attempting to use the selectable interaction from the JQueryUI library to be able to select from 175 rows of a table The selection is ordinarily responsive but we also offer filtering on this table implemented by hiding rows by setting the style to display none As soon as filtering was applied the selection became very unresponsive I managed to identify that the slowdown was caused by the refresh function defined at line 59 of at time of writing and managed to improve responsiveness by modifying the function to the following this refresh function selectees that options filter that element 0 selectees addClass ui selectee selectees each function var this this pos this offset visible this css display none data this selectable item element this element this left pos left top pos top right pos left visible this outerWidth 0 bottom pos top visible this outerHeight 0 startselected false selected this hasClass ui selected selecting this hasClass ui selecting unselecting this hasClass ui unselecting By bypassing the outerWidth and outerHeight calls against hidden elements the responsiveness was on par with the unfiltered version I was unable to find an existing issue that matched this problem however I did find a Stack Overflow post which encountered the same problem while interacting with a different part of the JQueryUI API posted three years ago This post also contains a link to a more featured benchmark for this particular problem than the demo I provided albeit for an older version of JQuery,,"dmethvin,dmethvin,timmywil",2015-02-24 15:55:50,2015-03-23 23:22:27

IS,jQuery Ajax Request with Headers,I have an Backbone application where the models are being sync would with the server When the backbone app makes requests to the API it needs to add an authorization token to the headers if the user is logged into the system This token allows the API to respond with data if it is not present in a request it will respond with a 401 I have been debugging this for days with Backbone and have deemed that it is a jQuery issue that I am facing The issue is that for two routes in my application ONLY IN SAFARI the authorization header is not being passed through to the API server from jQuery Backbone is in fact sending it through to jQuery As you can see from the logging above the Authorization token is passed through with Firefox Chrome BUT NOT with Safari for the second request,,,2015-04-06 22:47:33,2015-04-07 17:40:38

IS,Strange behavior with iframes title cased CSS and Chrome Webkit,Migrated from Thread Long story short I'm working on a project that is using jQuery to write DOM nodes to an iframe and I found some odd behavior with CSS classes containing capitalized characters I have narrowed it down to what seems to be an issue with jQuery is append function for wrapped HTML and it affects all versions of jQuery 1 x and 2 x Chromium Webkit based browsers only See the following JSFiddle using Google Chrome or Safari for the minimal test case Hopefully the comments are pretty self explanatory but as you can see I have a basic CSS class called TitleCase that will color text red I generate a simple div with this class name and add it to the DOM via append html markup here If I then try to append another DOM node containing that same class name to an iframe it breaks styles from that class in the parent DOM in other words the style definitions disappear There are a bunch of odd workarounds for this that seem to suggest this might be a bug with jQuery Workarounds Applying a setTimeout to delay the iframe manipulation Giving the affected DOM element additional CSS class names or dummy attributes Resorting to lowercase CSS class names Manually removing and re adding the class name to the DOM elements Passing a string directly to append Using another non jQuery method to generate the element and append it I suspect the problem lies in how jQuery is append method treats HTML text VS a jQuery object but i have not been able to pinpoint exactly why from jQuery is source code,,"gibson042,gibson042",2015-05-18 05:42:53,2015-05-18 20:19:05

IS,myForm trigger isubmit' when form contains an element named submit,If you try to do something like input type submit name submit I see coders doing this all the time they are unoriginal and can not think of a better name for a submit button than submit so bare with me I think it would be good to address such users Then when calling myForm trigger isubmit' for the form which contains this element it will fail to submit in the same way which myForm submit fails since it will reference the element rather than the submit function of the form I believe jQuery should add a check when dealing with submit to verify it is indeed a function before calling it If not you can still submit the form by grabbing a copy of the function by creating a new form dynamically grabbing its submit method then sending the form we want to submit through this function document createElement 'form' submit call myForm We could also try to do something like myForm constructor prototype submit but then they might have an element named constructor in their form resulting in the same sort of issue So I believe creating an element for it would be a good solution to grab the submit method and apply it to the function we wish to submit,,"markelog,dmethvin",2015-12-04 07:30:52,2015-12-04 14:15:12

PR,Hidden attribute solution for show hide toggle,A simpler solution for show hide toggle based on the HTML5 hidden attribute To avoid ambiguity regarding how to write CSS to ensure hidden elements should be hidden the hidden attribute value is set to hidden instead of empty This solution is more in line with best practices regarding how to show hide elements as it leaves it up to the author to ensure it is hidden properly via CSS essentially the same as the class based recommendation removing adding classes to control display It will also leave the inline style intact in case this is needed to overrule jQuery is toggling For responsive web sites this will also provide a better way to control whether or not the element should be shown as it can be controlled through the hidden attribute selector within the context being styled Not to mention this probably performs better than having to remember the computed styles and resetting these when showing the element Another option is to add a method unhide that removes the hidden attribute whereas show retains the functionality of the current code where its inline style is changed to force it to show,,timmywil,2016-01-25 14:02:41,2016-01-25 15:36:58

IS,IE9 pseudo selectors,Under ie9 when using a pseudo selector library jQuery executes the selector on every element on the page even though it was given an id for the element ' id in viewport' causes in viewport to be executed on every element on the page ' id' is ' in viewport' obviously does not This is a huge performance issue under IE9 This does not happen under chrome and likely under other browsers I unfortunately do not have the expertise in jQuery to determine where exactly the issue lies so I cannot provide a patch at this moment However I would suspect that this would be a great performance optimization for older browsers where if the CSS selector is given an ID it first searches by that instead of executing the pseudo selector code I tested this in IE9 windows 7 Also tested in Chrome 42 on GNU Linux arch jQuery version 1 11 2 Yes I realize that I'm talking about a 3rd party add on for jQuery I do not think it is the issue since the method defined for the in viewport inviewport is being called different numbers of times depending on browser version In IE9 it gets called hundreds of times with elements that are not the one specified by ID Under chrome it is just the element specified by ID It appears to be how jQuery handles ID selectors The use case I have is a site with an infinite stream of items I need to do something as the cards come into the viewport I have a list of IDs for the cards so I iterate over the IDs and run the in viewport pseudo selector on them I have a list of 30 ids that gets pared down when each item has entered the view port Under IE performance was abysmal running in viewport 30 times should not be too terrible and indeed it is not unless you are on IE9,,"gibson042,mgol,timmywil,gibson042",2015-04-23 17:32:19,2016-02-10 18:55:27

IS,Document Safari Mobile support,Now that jQuery 3 is out I looked at the browser support page and saw that only the Current and Current 1 versions of Safari are supported currently those should be 9 1 1 and 9 1 respectively Anyway the Mobile section also mentions support for iOS 7 If I'm not mistaken the first iOS 7 release came with Safari Mobile 6 1 preinstalled in late 2013 Does this mean that Safari Mobile 6 1 is actively supported by jQuery Or does it mean that iOS 7 is only supported when Safari Mobile is updated to the almost latest version I'm sorry if this sounds like a silly feature request I really wished those facts were better addressed by the documentation when reporting browsers versions and OS versions in the same list,,timmywil,2016-06-13 06:12:51,2016-06-13 17:44:19
